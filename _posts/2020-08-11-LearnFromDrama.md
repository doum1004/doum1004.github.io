Penny: Hey, Sheldon. What are you doing here?

Sheldon: This is a restaurant. It’s lunch time. I would think as a waitress you would be familiar with the paradigm

Penny: Is Leonard coming?

Sheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.

Penny: Well, that’s not gonna happen.

Sheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.

Penny: Which is?

Sheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.

Penny: I’m busy.

Sheldon: Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch.

Penny: Fine. What do you want?

Sheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich? Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?

Penny: No no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.

Sheldon: You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.

Penny: Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?

Sheldon: Of course not. I’ll have my usual.

Penny: Great

Sheldon: Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?

Penny: Don’t you usually get lemonade?

Sheldon: Yes

Penny: Do you want lemonade?

Sheldon: Yes

Penny: Anything else?

Sheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
