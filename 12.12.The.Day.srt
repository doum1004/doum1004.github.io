00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,171
<i>This film is inspired by actual events</i>

6
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,332
<i>however characters and situations have
been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.</i>

7
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:05,047
Did war break out?

8
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,214
Excuse me.

9
00:01:13,297 --> 00:01:14,380
General.

10
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,421
Col. Kang, what's going on?

11
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:18,505
I'm not sure either.

12
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:20,755
We're not under attack?

13
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:22,755
No, the front lines are fine.

14
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:25,046
This way.

15
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:26,546
The Prime Minister's here.

16
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,588
- What's going on?
- Later, sir.

17
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,755
A short time ago,

18
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:43,505
President Park passed away.

19
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:52,755
Let us offer a silent tribute and
open an emergency Cabinet meeting.

20
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,297
OCTOBER 26, 1979
PRESIDENT PARK ASSASSINATED

21
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:02,964
As appointed by the acting President,

22
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:06,047
I'm the new martial law commander.

23
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,547
The investigation into the shooting

24
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,922
will be led by General Chun
of Defense Security Command.

25
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:25,964
"To change the world..."
is that why you killed him?

26
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:29,172
Did you want to become
president so much?

27
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,922
No, how many times must I say it?

28
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,547
Did you think it'd work?

29
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:43,214
Did you go see a fortune teller?

30
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:48,672
Look outside. Nothing has changed.

31
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,797
The world is the same.

32
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:02,256
The dictator of 18 years was gone.

33
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:07,964
But the hoped-for new era did not come.

34
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,547
Those who craved the
vacated seat of power

35
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:17,672
ushered in an even greater darkness.

36
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,880
The story of that winter
has been completely hidden.

37
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:33,338
12.12: THE DAY

38
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:46,713
After the shocking death

39
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:49,172
of our President Park,

40
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:51,630
the whole country...

41
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:54,630
Hey.

42
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:57,379
How's that? Too serious?

43
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,421
No, you sound very dignified.

44
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:03,630
You could try making it more relaxed.

45
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,672
I look uptight?

46
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:11,714
If I'm relaxed it'll look weird.

47
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,505
The whole country
will be watching on TV.

48
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,421
The Joint Investigation Commander

49
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:34,880
will give a brief on the
president's assassination.

50
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:45,296
After the shocking death
of our President Park,

51
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,380
<i>the whole nation must be sorrowful</i>

52
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:52,255
<i>and curious about the incident,</i>

53
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:55,422
<i>so we issue this interim report.</i>

54
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,296
<i>Kim asked,</i>

55
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:04,796
<i>"How could you run a country with
this useless maggot by your side?"</i>

56
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:10,755
<i>Then Dir. Kim drew a gun
and shot the Security Chief first.</i>

57
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,296
Gen. Lee Tae-shin is here.

58
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,338
Go in.

59
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:16,921
<i>General!</i>

60
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:20,255
<i>Why was Chief Jeong at
the scene of the shooting?</i>

61
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:25,089
<i>The Chief of Staff is not
currently under suspicion.</i>

62
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:31,463
I heard General Chun feels
uncomfortable around you.

63
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:33,046
Is that true?

64
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:37,755
I thought that was all in the
past. But I'm not sure how he feels.

65
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,213
What do you think of Hanahoe?

66
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:45,006
I think private groups should
have no place in the military.

67
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,170
You wrote an interesting paper
when you were director of research.

68
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,338
It was about focusing
on military intelligence,

69
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,714
and getting rid of the power hungry
Defence Security Command, right?

70
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:03,754
I was a Lieutenant Colonel
then, but I was scolded so much

71
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:06,880
that I erased it from my memory.

72
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:10,922
Sir, I'd like to know
why you called me today.

73
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:21,255
I want to make you Capital
Garrison Commander.

74
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:25,505
Everyone wants that job,

75
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:29,297
so I'll give it to someone who's
not driven by greed, like you.

76
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,839
The army generals tell me

77
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,714
you're old-fashioned,
but you know your duty.

78
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:40,297
They say you don't care about politics.

79
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,088
That you're a real soldier. Come, sit.

80
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:47,463
You'll do it, right?

81
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,630
I'm truly grateful,

82
00:06:55,714 --> 00:07:00,046
but may I ask the reason
for this excessive offer?

83
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,297
I just don't understand.

84
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:09,130
Are you turning down the
offer to be CGC Commander?

85
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,755
Yes, I am.

86
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:22,589
Something on your mind?

87
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,839
No.

88
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,796
General Chun is coming.

89
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,296
I know our vice-ministers are busy.

90
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:35,547
Sorry to call you here. Please sit.

91
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,005
Make yourself comfortable.

92
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:40,547
I wanted to call the
administrators too,

93
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:44,338
but as you can see, my office is tiny.

94
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:50,254
Colonel Ha. Start the meeting.

95
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:51,421
Yes, sir.

96
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,088
- We'll start with Foreign Affairs.
- No, no.

97
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:57,005
Home Affairs first.

98
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:58,297
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,172
Then...

100
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,630
- Vice Minister Yang?
- Yes.

101
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:07,922
Regarding your order...

102
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,297
<i>Hearing each department's report,</i>

103
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,088
Chun laughed and said, "This
is just like a Cabinet meeting!"

104
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,297
That's what I heard.

105
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,589
Just look at him.

106
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:31,213
He thinks he's the king.

107
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:34,379
What are we supposed to do about him?

108
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,754
As for me, I hope

109
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:41,463
our troops can be reborn
through this opportunity

110
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:44,171
to meet the expectations of the people.

111
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,212
That's it for now.

112
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:46,504
General!

113
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,962
It seems our society will take
big steps toward democracy.

114
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,505
What are your thoughts?

115
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,505
Who do you write for?

116
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:58,505
Haven't we always
been a democratic nation?

117
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,672
<i>As we move past this national crisis,</i>

118
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:06,130
<i>I wish for our military to focus</i>

119
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,921
<i>on its core mission
of national defense.</i>

120
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:12,005
<i>However,</i>

121
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:18,881
<i>if there are people here
more concerned about politics,</i>

122
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:23,505
<i>I am terribly worried, and
believe it to be dangerous.</i>

123
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,255
What's he saying?

124
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,505
Who's he talking to?

125
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,254
How ridiculous.

126
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,880
- Is he talking to us?
- Worried about us?

127
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:33,464
Better worry about himself.

128
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,839
Be quiet, will you?

129
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,171
That was a great speech.

130
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,297
Glad you think so.

131
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,839
Are you sure about making
Lee the CGC Commander?

132
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,588
He's not bad,

133
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,921
but the Garrison Command
guards the nation's capital.

134
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,546
The commanders today were worried...

135
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,630
What's your point?

136
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:06,297
It's not because he
isn't a KMA graduate,

137
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,880
but he can be headstrong
like other OCS graduates.

138
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:11,004
The job needs someone
more sophisticated.

139
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,672
Like who?

140
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:15,464
What about Gen. Roh Tae-gun?

141
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:32,380
Don't I have the authority
to appoint personnel?

142
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
Sir?

143
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,547
Do I need your permission
to make decisions?

144
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,088
Perhaps you
misunderstood, my point is...

145
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:47,547
I'll pretend I didn't
hear your point, okay?

146
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,963
Chief shouldn't treat you that way.

147
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:56,254
Lee doesn't know his
place to accept that job.

148
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,756
That's enough.

149
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,547
General Lee.

150
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,796
Congratulations.

151
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,963
For what?

152
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:18,505
I was so happy to hear it.

153
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:22,130
- Now that you're the CGC...
- I'm not.

154
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,505
You're turning it down?

155
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:30,880
You must be busy with the
DSC and the investigation.

156
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:35,172
Our service means nothing
without self-sacrifice, right?

157
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:37,589
I've been so concerned lately,

158
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:40,339
I've got no hair left.

159
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,962
How's the investigation on Kim going?

160
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,339
We'll get it done before the trial.

161
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,505
I heard the DSC is locking
people up indiscriminately.

162
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,672
Is that true?

163
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:59,422
Everyone is looking forward
to a so-called Seoul Spring.

164
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:05,130
So why arrest and torture
people not related to the case?

165
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,339
We all know you love our country.

166
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:16,213
Just don't be so intimidating.

167
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,880
I understand what you're saying.

168
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:29,171
But I'll decide how to handle that.

169
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:30,172
Yes.

170
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:32,922
I'm sure you will.

171
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,589
And moving around in a pack,

172
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:39,963
it doesn't look good.

173
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,631
General, you know,

174
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:52,505
I am honestly thinking maybe
you and I should get closer.

175
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,505
We could benefit from being on
the same side at this difficult time.

176
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:02,214
Everyone in the Korean
Army is on the same side.

177
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:08,755
Wow. You think so?

178
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,671
See you around.

179
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:26,172
How many times must I ask?

180
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:33,880
I think you should find someone better.

181
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,922
I'm really sorry, sir.

182
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:42,671
Stay for dinner.

183
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,795
It's being prepared.

184
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:44,962
I'm alright.

185
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:48,464
You can't come all this
way and leave without dinner!

186
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,464
Please, stay.

187
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,797
I think I'd better go.

188
00:13:56,214 --> 00:14:00,005
If I wanted someone to do
politics, I wouldn't ask you!

189
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,339
After Chun took over the
DSC and the investigation

190
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:14,088
he got his hands on
all the intelligence,

191
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,838
and he's been acting
like the whole world is his.

192
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:22,713
Will you let Hanahoe
take over this post as well?

193
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,297
It's a critical time for our nation.

194
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,339
By myself,

195
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,464
I can't...

196
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,422
I can't do anything.

197
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:40,214
I need you to protect
Seoul. That's all I need.

198
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,464
As the Army Chief of
Staff, I entrust you, soldier

199
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,214
with this mission.

200
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,214
Troops, attention!

201
00:14:57,506 --> 00:15:01,338
Present arms!

202
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,506
Allegiance!

203
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,380
Since its establishment, the CGC...

204
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:13,379
As commander of the CGC,

205
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,838
I swear to carry out my duties,

206
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,880
for the safety and
prosperity of the capital,

207
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:22,130
and to faithfully serve my country.

208
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,962
Colonel Jang Min-gi, sir!

209
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:30,962
Everyone knows Jang
is a Hanahoe member.

210
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,130
Yes.

211
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,546
Col. Won, the Military
Police Commander.

212
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,381
He's wily and full of tricks.

213
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,089
Colonel Won Gyung, sir!

214
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,755
Colonel Jin Young-do.

215
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:46,005
The 33rd Division Commander,
and an infamous Hanahoe member.

216
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,713
Colonel Jin Young-do, sir!

217
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,545
I'll need your help the most.

218
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:50,381
Yes, sir!

219
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,506
They're pledged Hanahoe members,
we can't expect them to cooperate.

220
00:15:54,713 --> 00:15:57,422
So, they might disobey my orders?

221
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,587
Answer yes or no.

222
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:02,797
If I break this pledge
signed with blood,

223
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,047
I will give my life for
my fellow members.

224
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,672
Nothing compares to
the glory of Hanahoe!

225
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:14,713
I will forever remember the honor
of being chosen as a member.

226
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:17,254
- Allegiance!
- Allegiance!

227
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:20,464
It's run under such a cloud of secrecy,

228
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,214
they themselves don't
know who's in the group.

229
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,214
- At ease.
- At ease.

230
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:28,671
- I pledge my life, sir.
- Alright, alright.

231
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:29,880
Come here.

232
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,464
Come, sit.

233
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,797
Are you afraid?

234
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,005
It's just a chair.

235
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,338
No, sir. I'm not afraid.

236
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:46,130
Then sit. Think of it as your seat.

237
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,755
From now on, you're me.

238
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:03,755
And I'm you.

239
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:22,129
Yesterday, the US State Dept.
wired the US Embassy.

240
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,797
A brief message, it says
"Be wary of General Chun."

241
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:32,588
We don't need Eom or Jeon.

242
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:37,005
Hopefully all our members
will be promoted to generals.

243
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,214
I spoke with the Chairman.
It's a done deal.

244
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:43,964
Also, I made the reorganization
plan you asked for.

245
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,672
What do we do about Chief Jeong?

246
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,964
Make him Minister of Defense?

247
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,381
Take him out.

248
00:17:55,713 --> 00:18:00,214
Sir, maybe you should
talk with Chief Jeong.

249
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:03,172
- To be on good terms...
- Shut it!

250
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:07,089
No point in talking
to that stubborn fool.

251
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,297
There was $900K in the
president's secret vault.

252
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,130
We gave $600K to President
Park's eldest daughter,

253
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:19,256
left $100K for us at
the Joint Investigation,

254
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:25,338
and we have $200K here for you to use.

255
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:29,256
Shouldn't that money go
to the National Treasury?

256
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,838
Yes, that is customary.

257
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,005
But then things can get messy...

258
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,046
So this is why people say

259
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:41,880
you have the KCIA, Presidential
Security, and the DSC

260
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:45,172
all in your pocket.

261
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,089
Excuse me?

262
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,337
Who's saying that absurd...

263
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,380
It's not about who.

264
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:58,172
You should think about why they say it.

265
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,214
You're supposed to report
these things to me before,

266
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,172
not afterward.

267
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:17,630
Did you expect praise?

268
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:24,671
First I need to know who's
spreading these absurd rumors.

269
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:26,296
- General.
- Yes?

270
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:30,797
You still don't know
what you did wrong?

271
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,214
To be frank,

272
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:40,214
I don't think I did anything wrong.

273
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,463
I want the Joint
Investigation to report to me

274
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:50,588
all acquired intelligence
every day, once every 3 hours.

275
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,629
If you wish, sir.

276
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,964
You're dismissed.

277
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,588
Get him awake, quickly.

278
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,672
Yes, sir.

279
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,755
Bring me that.

280
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:25,214
Did I sign this investigation report?

281
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,672
Yes, two days ago, sir.

282
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,630
What was the conclusion?

283
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:33,047
That Chief Jeong is under
no suspicions of conspiring.

284
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,630
Are you a judge?

285
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:45,172
The assassin called Jeong
to the safe house that night.

286
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:49,547
Jeong was there when
our President was shot!

287
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,131
Isn't it suspicious?

288
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:54,213
It sure is to me.

289
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,839
Find out how he and
Kim conspired together!

290
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:03,380
Why he went all the
way there just to eat!

291
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:09,630
Is Jeong a bad guy too?

292
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:14,296
I really want to know, Col. Lim.

293
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:23,755
Sir.

294
00:21:23,755 --> 00:21:24,422
Yes?

295
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,547
We must hurry and disband
the Joint Investigation.

296
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,130
I said we'll do it next spring.
The trial's not even over.

297
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,546
This is today's morning paper.

298
00:21:31,547 --> 00:21:32,921
Take a look.

299
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:35,088
Looks good to me. What's wrong?

300
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:39,089
What's wrong is that Chun
is telling them what to write.

301
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,964
He's beating and threatening
people with no relation to the case.

302
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,505
Chun, that bastard...

303
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:49,921
We can't leave him be.

304
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,921
But he has many supporters too.

305
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:56,547
Exactly, you know
Hanahoe is the real problem.

306
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,462
They're young men.

307
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:02,421
Press them too hard,
and they'll fight back.

308
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:07,131
Sir, did Chun offer you something?

309
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,297
Who, me?

310
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,421
Who's saying such nonsense?

311
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:16,964
That's outrageous.

312
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,588
I said no, but he
shoved it into my pocket.

313
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:24,254
I haven't even opened the envelope.

314
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,587
You can have it if you want.

315
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,171
Sir.

316
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:31,171
Alright, do as you want.

317
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,755
The martial law commander
has decided, so what can I do?

318
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,089
When we reassign command
at the end of the year,

319
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:42,006
I want to send him to
the East Coast Defense.

320
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:43,422
That far away?

321
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:47,047
- Minister, everyone's waiting.
- Okay.

322
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,380
Honey.

323
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:59,547
General Roh is here.

324
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,797
You're being sent to
the East Coast Defense.

325
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,297
And I'm going to the
56th Defense Division.

326
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:14,880
They're sending all of
us to useless positions.

327
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,796
I knew this'd happen when Lee
was named CGC commander.

328
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:29,006
We can't back out. What should we do?

329
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:31,922
All of us will end up kicked out.

330
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:35,088
Kicked out, my ass.

331
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:39,754
He's not the only one with power. I'm
Director of the Joint Investigation.

332
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:43,213
So? You're gonna lock him up?

333
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,046
I could.

334
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:47,713
I've got control over
all the intelligence.

335
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:54,338
I can find out what your
cousins eat for dinner.

336
00:23:54,422 --> 00:23:58,630
I can even turn your dog into a commie!

337
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:06,922
Jeong, that bastard, heard His
Excellency being shot with his own ears.

338
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,839
But he's got nothing
to do with the plot?

339
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,922
Can you be sure?

340
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,046
Doo-gwang, he's the
martial law commander.

341
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:19,130
How can you outfox the
martial law commander?

342
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:20,839
Hey,

343
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:22,589
look at this.

344
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,714
Black almost lost the game.

345
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,547
But...

346
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:31,755
with only one move,
the tables are turned.

347
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:42,255
You wanna do as I say?

348
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,964
You wanna flip the tables?

349
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,130
Are you insane?

350
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:58,172
Well then, I'll go to the East Coast.

351
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,380
You go sweat your ass
off at the Defense Division

352
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:04,464
and play some tennis, you fool.

353
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:07,380
We've come far enough.

354
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:10,087
Honestly, man,

355
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,547
I think you should go to Chief Jeong,

356
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,255
kneel in front of him,
and ask for mercy.

357
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:20,922
But I know you won't do that.

358
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,963
Honey, aren't you having dinner?

359
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,881
<i>And so the vote results were announced.</i>

360
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:36,955
<i>Among 2,549 total votes,
Choi Han-kyu received 2,465.</i>

361
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:40,421
<i>Before the election,
President Choi emphasized</i>

362
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:42,212
<i>stability in times of crisis...</i>

363
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:46,797
To hell with those clowns.

364
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:53,297
No turning back.

365
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:54,547
Only forward!

366
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,547
Wait, hold on.

367
00:25:56,963 --> 00:26:01,338
Let's think about this
a couple more days.

368
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,881
You idiot.

369
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,881
Just give up then!

370
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,255
You always have your way anyway!

371
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:25,338
Friend, you remember?

372
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:31,047
When our President Park
carried out the May 16 revolution,

373
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:36,005
even then, nobody knew how to react.

374
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:40,588
That's when I stepped up.

375
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:44,714
I called up all the army
cadets to do a big parade,

376
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:47,714
it was like a big party!

377
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:50,547
Stop with that talk.

378
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,921
That was ages ago!

379
00:26:56,547 --> 00:27:00,172
You think this is the same?

380
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,756
Back then,

381
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,213
never for one second

382
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:24,255
did I doubt our President would
achieve his great revolution.

383
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:26,172
So I'm telling you...

384
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:31,213
don't dare tell me I might fail.

385
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:51,088
Cheers, everyone!

386
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,879
- We are...!
- We are...!

387
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,631
- One!
- One!

388
00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:01,756
Sit, sit down.

389
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:03,380
Sir.

390
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,088
There you are.

391
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:08,130
I had a flat tire.

392
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:14,130
Oh my!

393
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,546
Welcome, sir!

394
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:17,880
Keep drinking. Don't stand up.

395
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,047
You made it!

396
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:19,921
- Welcome.
- Sir!

397
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:21,005
Come, sit.

398
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,631
How've you been?

399
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,047
You got here fast.

400
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,796
- Have a look.
- Sure.

401
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:44,213
We gathered today for this.

402
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:46,422
Read it over carefully.

403
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,422
We focused on two
suspicions of criminal facilitation.

404
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:53,714
You shut it.

405
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:58,380
You should explain this.

406
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:01,421
Ask me anything, sir.

407
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:04,464
I understand why
you want to arrest him.

408
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:06,547
But what if it fails?

409
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,796
Sir.

410
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:21,214
This investigation
is under military law.

411
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:22,922
So how can it fail?

412
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:25,838
This is completely illegal!

413
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,547
General,

414
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:32,463
then should I just crawl
away and leave the army?

415
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,422
It's not that, sir.

416
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:38,838
We're worried things can
get ugly while arresting Jeong.

417
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:42,672
Then it'd be a coup.

418
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:55,588
Why not call it a
grand revolution, then?

419
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:56,837
What?

420
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,713
If we get the President's approval,

421
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,631
there won't be any problem.

422
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:10,631
But won't we need to go
through the Minister of Defense?

423
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:14,796
I said, don't worry about it.

424
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:17,880
Don't worry about getting approval!

425
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:22,880
Colonels and under, listen up.

426
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:29,297
You were all smart enough to
go to the best colleges, right?

427
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:34,506
But without money or connections,
you ended up at the Military Academy.

428
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:39,630
Now with all those brainless
cronies lining up in front of you,

429
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,880
your chances of promotion
are shit. Is that fair?

430
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,547
Look me in the eye!

431
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:53,922
I'm saying, let's fix our
army, and clear out the trash!

432
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,630
Generals.

433
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:06,880
By spring, you all will
have to leave the army too.

434
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:09,589
Can you go to Jeong,

435
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:14,838
and ask him to promote you
instead of discharging you?

436
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:23,422
I'm sure you remember what
our President Park used to say.

437
00:31:24,838 --> 00:31:29,671
"The night of revolution is
short, but its glory lasts forever."

438
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,547
I will maintain that glory,

439
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:35,922
but I won't keep it all to myself.

440
00:31:36,922 --> 00:31:38,922
Please believe me.

441
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:44,047
Can you keep your word?

442
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:48,255
Do I need to write it in blood for you?

443
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:56,255
I'll take that, ma'am.

444
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,630
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

445
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,630
Why do I feel...

446
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:26,255
like we just might
be able to pull it off?

447
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:30,630
If we do this,

448
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,963
when would it be?

449
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:36,255
The day before they
announce the new Cabinet.

450
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:38,297
December 12th?

451
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,255
What about Gen. Lee Tae-shin
and Gen. Gong Soo-hyuk?

452
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:48,381
Lee in particular,
he's not going to listen.

453
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:51,921
This way.

454
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:54,172
Col. Moon from DSC is here to see you.

455
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:56,380
Why is he here?

456
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:57,505
General.

457
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,921
We'll fire two batteries
simultaneously for effect.

458
00:32:59,922 --> 00:33:01,588
General Chun's birthday?

459
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:04,296
He should spend it with his family.

460
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:07,171
He's invited Gen. Gong,
Gen. Kim, and you, sir.

461
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,837
He wants to treat you
three to a nice warm meal.

462
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:12,921
Go tell him I'll consider
myself already treated.

463
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:16,504
Sir, I don't know if you've heard,

464
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:19,713
but there's a rumor Gen. Chun
will be sent to the east coast.

465
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:23,755
- Our general...
- And what did he say?

466
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:29,381
Well, he's not very pleased.

467
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:34,214
But he's a man with a big
heart, so he just laughed it off.

468
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:35,922
General, we're ready.

469
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,755
Anyway, before he leaves,

470
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,921
he wants to spend time
with the three of you...

471
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,463
Troops!

472
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:49,255
Ready guns!

473
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:52,463
- Fire!
- Fire!

474
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,421
You sure he's coming?

475
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,047
I'm almost sure.

476
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,005
What? "Almost"?

477
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:06,297
Never seen you so doubtful, Moon.

478
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:08,129
I'll make him come, sir.

479
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:13,005
Right. He's a stubborn mule,
so you have to keep at him.

480
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,587
I still think we should grab Jeong
on his way to the residence...

481
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,921
No, let me explain it again.

482
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:25,672
Look, we'll all gather
at the 30th Security.

483
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,420
<i>Even if shots are
fired during the arrest,</i>

484
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:35,256
DECEMBER 12
<i>most of CGC's combat troops are here.</i>

485
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:41,005
<i>There are only two security
groups in this whole area.</i>

486
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,547
<i>So, if we set up our base
in the 30th Security,</i>

487
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,630
<i>no one can touch us.</i>

488
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:50,256
From 9 a.m.,

489
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,880
it's possible to monitor all
communication networks.

490
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:58,130
Good afternoon, sir.

491
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,255
You're early.

492
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:01,797
Where is Gen. Chun?

493
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,797
Gentlemen.

494
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,380
Why wait out here?

495
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:15,463
At least you recognized me.

496
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,213
I thought you forgot your wife's face.

497
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:18,713
Come on.

498
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,630
I plan to go home
today, even if it's late.

499
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:23,130
Nice to hear you say it at least.

500
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,712
You're not skipping meals, are you?

501
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,047
They won't let a general starve.

502
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,129
Come inside.

503
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,129
I'm sure you're busy.

504
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,379
You go in.

505
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,964
Come on, have a cup of warm tea.

506
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:40,588
I brought new underwear and
socks, so change if you need to.

507
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,755
Don't embarrass me.

508
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,922
Hello, ma'am.

509
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:47,297
- Colonel, it's been awhile.
- Yes.

510
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,256
Sir, we're ready to start the meeting.

511
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:54,964
- To make it to that dinner...
- Right, the one with Chun?

512
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:56,922
I'll get going now.

513
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:00,256
General!

514
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:02,004
General Lee will attend tonight.

515
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:03,297
Great.

516
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:06,005
Get the lights.

517
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:09,922
I'll describe today's plan.

518
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:16,421
Gen. Chun will get the President's
approval at around 18:30.

519
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:20,047
At the same time,
Jeong will be arrested.

520
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:24,587
<i>Colonels Ha and Yoon
will oversee the arrest.</i>

521
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,256
They have troops standing by now.

522
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:30,171
Just in case,

523
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:35,879
we'll keep these three
men occupied at the party,

524
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,380
so it'll be hard for them
to mobilize their troops.

525
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:40,255
Most important

526
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:43,214
is to get the President's
approval at the time of arrest.

527
00:36:43,296 --> 00:36:47,463
If we carry this out legally,
our plan will succeed.

528
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:55,005
Wipe those frowns off your faces!

529
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,713
I'll wrap this up for sure.

530
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:03,463
Col. Lim!

531
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,005
What's wrong?

532
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:09,172
Jeong wants to see you at Army HQ.

533
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:15,172
Did he find out?

534
00:37:15,797 --> 00:37:17,296
No way.

535
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,797
It seemed like he had no idea.

536
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,047
<i>Stay calm and go see him.</i>

537
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,880
General Chun is here.

538
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:33,964
Sir, you asked to see me?

539
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:37,797
I know what you're thinking, General.

540
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:43,338
Of course I do.

541
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:51,547
You must've been upset,
hearing about your new post.

542
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,672
But what does it matter
where a soldier serves?

543
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:02,047
I hope you'll do this for us
to help reform the troops.

544
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,839
Of course, sir.

545
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:06,797
Don't you worry.

546
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:11,296
Anyway, I have a favor to ask.

547
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,213
Things have been chaotic lately,

548
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:16,547
and we've gotten less
vigilant about the North.

549
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:21,755
Soon, everyone will be
focused on Director Kim's trial.

550
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:25,421
I thought you might make Kim

551
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:29,672
mention the threat of pro-communists
during his final statement.

552
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:36,463
That is a great idea.

553
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:41,672
Anyway, please wrap things up well.

554
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:54,839
Sir.

555
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,672
I must report something to
you about the investigation.

556
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,922
Can I have my men visit
you at the residence tonight?

557
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:05,089
Can't we do it tomorrow?

558
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:07,338
It won't take long.

559
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,213
These damn judges are so impatient.

560
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:16,422
Why did he want to see you?

561
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:17,755
Give me a cigarette.

562
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:33,130
Looks like I picked
the perfect party day.

563
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:39,255
Report to General Roh.
We're sticking to the plan!

564
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:07,088
Where are we?

565
00:40:09,297 --> 00:40:11,672
Does Chun drink at
these kinds of places?

566
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:15,714
Welcome, sir.

567
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,130
- Won Gyung?
- Yes, sir.

568
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:19,880
Why are you here?

569
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:23,129
Gen. Chun was called by the
Chief and is running a bit late.

570
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,171
He asked me to keep you company.

571
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:28,046
The host isn't here?

572
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:32,504
- Let's just go.
- Pardon, sir?

573
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:34,005
You heard me.

574
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:36,171
- Back to Garrison Command.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,255
Wait, General!

576
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:46,755
Hey, General.

577
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:52,547
What's your business?

578
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:54,714
It's General Chun.

579
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,255
What's your business?

580
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,422
It's the DSC Director of Intelligence.

581
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,005
Identity confirmed!

582
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:26,505
- Hello, General.
- It's been a while.

583
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:28,755
You've come a long way. Please.

584
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:38,922
We're relieving the guards.

585
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:43,838
It's the new shift of
guards. Just let them in.

586
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,338
But...

587
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,504
There are much more than usual.

588
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,589
What the hell do you mean?

589
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,213
We need to check inside the vehicles.

590
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,380
Everyone step out, please.

591
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,172
Hey, no need for that.

592
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:07,380
Yes, I know. But we have rules.

593
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:10,505
You little...

594
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:14,422
All four of you will be seeing him?

595
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:17,547
This way, please.

596
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,671
Would you like to see
our girls perform, sir?

597
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,672
Is Chun coming or not?

598
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,213
Well...

599
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:33,045
I'll go call the Chief's residence
to see when he's coming.

600
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:34,255
Don't bother.

601
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:36,713
Madame, where's the phone here?

602
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,380
Sir, I'll make the call.

603
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:41,005
You stay out of it.

604
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:45,588
Sir, I'll check with
the Chief's residence.

605
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:49,088
- Why don't you just sit?
- He'll be here soon.

606
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:51,213
- Won, go make the call.
- Yes, sir.

607
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:03,921
Mr. President.

608
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:09,088
Sir, sorry to bother
you at this late hour.

609
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,005
What brings you here?

610
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:18,714
Something requires
your approval right now.

611
00:43:22,088 --> 00:43:24,422
My approval, at this hour?

612
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:26,255
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

613
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:28,422
It is an urgent matter.

614
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:33,421
Please, sit.

615
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:36,464
I'm leaving with my wife
soon, so make it quick.

616
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,254
It's been a while.

617
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:39,797
Have a seat.

618
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,339
You're the DSC Head of Intelligence?

619
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:44,297
Yes, sir.

620
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,838
Gen. Chun said it's urgent. What is it?

621
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,880
We need your statement
for Director Kim's trial.

622
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,756
My statement?

623
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,213
What more do you need?

624
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:01,837
It'll just be a simple question.

625
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:02,963
Really?

626
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:05,714
Well, whatever it is,
let's take care of it here.

627
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:07,464
That's not possible.

628
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:12,505
We'd like you to come
to where we can record it.

629
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,464
Record it?

630
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:18,963
Yes, sir.

631
00:44:18,964 --> 00:44:22,464
You think I don't know what that means?

632
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:26,379
Director Kim has a new statement.

633
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,339
What kind of statement?

634
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:34,379
A statement saying you received money.

635
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,963
That's absurd!

636
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:39,714
I was confirmed to have no part in it!

637
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:42,463
It's an order from our superiors.

638
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:45,213
Your superiors? Listen here.

639
00:44:46,213 --> 00:44:48,921
I give orders to your superior!

640
00:44:49,297 --> 00:44:51,213
Who the hell was it?

641
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,714
Unless it was the President.

642
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:02,213
The President told you to do this?

643
00:45:05,922 --> 00:45:07,464
Yes, sir.

644
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:15,922
It can't be.

645
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:20,963
We talked just yesterday.

646
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:27,838
Adjutant! Come here!

647
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:29,464
Yes, sir.

648
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:33,962
Call the President
immediately. Tell him it's urgent.

649
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:36,421
- Yes, sir.
- What's this? What are you guys?

650
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:38,171
Stop that call, now!

651
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:39,547
Answer me!

652
00:45:44,672 --> 00:45:46,421
- What was that?
- Sir, come with us.

653
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:47,713
Don't move!

654
00:45:47,963 --> 00:45:49,172
Chief!

655
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:51,837
- Drop your gun!
- Marines!

656
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:52,838
Do something!

657
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:07,214
Looks like Chun won't be joining us.

658
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,712
He summons all three capital
defense commanders to one place,

659
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:12,004
and makes us wait.

660
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:13,129
Hey, Won.

661
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,338
Yes, sir.

662
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,005
What happened to Chun?

663
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,505
He said he left the residence.

664
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:22,339
There seems to be a lot of traffic.

665
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,796
Sir, let's leave in 10 minutes.

666
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:46,463
Freeze!

667
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:47,671
Out of the way!

668
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:00,713
Stop firing, you bastards!

669
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:03,339
- Colonel...
- Unload everyone.

670
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:06,631
Shots have been fired
at the Chief's residence.

671
00:47:06,713 --> 00:47:08,046
Shit, who shot first?

672
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:11,172
And the Chief? Did they arrest him?

673
00:47:11,713 --> 00:47:14,255
Did they leave the compound or not?

674
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:17,464
- What about General Chun?
- We need approval.

675
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:20,338
You should've informed Chun first!

676
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,879
He better have the
President's approval!

677
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,005
Please, let me figure this out first.

678
00:47:39,547 --> 00:47:40,755
Wasn't he...

679
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:45,422
cleared of all charges?

680
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:51,339
We must cross-examine him with
Kim to make sure he's really innocent.

681
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:04,213
Marines! Marines!
I'm the chief of staff!

682
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,089
Cover him up!

683
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,339
They're kidnapping me!

684
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:08,422
Marines...

685
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:09,629
What's going on?

686
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,046
It's a special operation. Back off.

687
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:14,089
You two! Hold it right there!

688
00:48:14,172 --> 00:48:15,338
Marines!

689
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,047
Chief!

690
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:17,172
Marines!

691
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:18,547
Chief!

692
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,338
- Honey.
- What?

693
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:38,713
You scared me.

694
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:41,588
Are we at war?

695
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,506
What do we do?

696
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:07,380
Sir!

697
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:09,046
There was a shooting
at the Chief's residence.

698
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,047
I know. His wife called...

699
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:17,546
Taxi!

700
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:20,588
Good evening.

701
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:22,922
Where to?

702
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:31,088
Where's Colonel Won?

703
00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:34,214
He was using the toilet. I'm not sure.

704
00:49:36,797 --> 00:49:37,630
Did they arrest...

705
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:39,255
Won!

706
00:49:39,922 --> 00:49:41,172
Won Gyung.

707
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:43,672
What are you doing?

708
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:47,505
Come on out.

709
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,339
Now!

710
00:49:54,797 --> 00:49:56,005
Won.

711
00:49:56,214 --> 00:49:57,380
Stop right there!

712
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:59,005
Sir!

713
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:03,089
We have a situation
at the Chief's residence.

714
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:04,922
What is it?

715
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,089
What?

716
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:10,755
As long as you authorize
it, there's no problem, sir.

717
00:50:12,964 --> 00:50:15,546
Chief Jeong is your direct superior,

718
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:20,381
and he's the martial law commander
appointed by the state council.

719
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:24,880
Come back tomorrow with the Minister.

720
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,047
Tomorrow is too late.

721
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:31,005
Approve this now, please.

722
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:34,047
I said to wait outside. Stay put.

723
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,755
Yes.

724
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:39,588
Hold on.

725
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:43,088
So, you're saying
the President is fine?

726
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:44,921
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

727
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:46,214
But...

728
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,797
Is something wrong?

729
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,089
Attention everyone!

730
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:52,713
The commander's here.

731
00:50:52,797 --> 00:50:53,672
Is everyone on the way?

732
00:50:53,673 --> 00:50:56,296
The 30th and 33rd
Security are not responding.

733
00:50:56,297 --> 00:50:58,130
Where's the MP deputy?

734
00:50:58,214 --> 00:51:00,089
Lt. Col. Heo is on his way.

735
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:02,005
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

736
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:03,339
Give it to me.

737
00:51:04,922 --> 00:51:07,214
Lt. Colonel, it's me.

738
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:11,296
Take the APCs and strike force,
and go to the Chief's residence.

739
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:12,838
Sir...

740
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,463
Call the medical unit!

741
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:18,713
Take him to the
hospital! Why is he here?

742
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:21,339
Kwon, are you alright?

743
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:25,214
We were hit by the Security Command.

744
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:26,547
The DSC?

745
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:28,379
What about the Chief?

746
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,547
I just arrived at the army bunker.

747
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,587
I'll look into Chun's whereabouts.

748
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:36,005
<i>Okay. I'm heading to
the Chief's residence.</i>

749
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,339
<i>You search the DSC and
Prime Minister's residence,</i>

750
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:41,546
and find that bastard Chun!

751
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:44,420
<i>Then, we ask that
bastard his motive for...</i>

752
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:46,755
Why are you still standing around?

753
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:50,047
There's nothing I can do!

754
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,505
- I got it.
- Yes, sir.

755
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:00,089
This is Lt. Col. Lee at the guardhouse.

756
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:02,420
This is the Provost Marshal.
What's the status there?

757
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:06,338
The DSC commander
is visiting, but that's it.

758
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:08,921
Chun is there now?

759
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:13,296
<i>Yes, he came to see the
President about an hour ago.</i>

760
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,839
Is something wrong, sir?

761
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:19,797
I've got one question.
Give me a straight answer.

762
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:21,630
Yes, sir.

763
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:24,129
Are you with Hanahoe?

764
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,505
<i>Sir?</i>

765
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:28,297
<i>No. Not at all, sir.</i>

766
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,047
Okay.

767
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,713
Listen to me carefully.

768
00:52:34,797 --> 00:52:37,671
When General Chun
comes out, arrest him at once.

769
00:52:37,672 --> 00:52:38,922
Pardon?

770
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:41,712
Get General Roh, now!

771
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:44,171
Chun abducted our Chief of Staff.

772
00:52:44,172 --> 00:52:48,214
<i>You have to be discreet.
There's no room for mistakes.</i>

773
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,005
You may open fire if he resists.

774
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:52,505
<i>Arrest him at all costs.</i>

775
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,046
- Presidential Security.
- <i>Chief Kang.</i>

776
00:52:58,047 --> 00:52:59,213
It's me, Roh.

777
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:00,213
Yes, General.

778
00:53:00,214 --> 00:53:02,089
<i>See one of our men there?</i>

779
00:53:02,172 --> 00:53:04,755
- You know, Lt. Col. Lim.
- <i>Ah, yes.</i>

780
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,839
Hello, sir.

781
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,713
Get General Chun out of there.

782
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:12,256
He's still with the president.

783
00:53:12,296 --> 00:53:14,338
Go get him now!

784
00:53:18,338 --> 00:53:21,421
Lt. Colonel, come here.

785
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,755
Tell me what's happening, now!

786
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:33,463
Call me when you get
through to the Minister.

787
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,797
Mr. President, it's urgent.
This cannot wait any longer.

788
00:53:41,547 --> 00:53:43,838
Didn't I tell you already?

789
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,546
By protocol, you must
consult the Minister first.

790
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:49,922
Protocol...

791
00:53:51,214 --> 00:53:53,337
Sure, that's important.

792
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:58,131
And that's why I'm begging
for your decision on this matter.

793
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,047
Look, Commander.

794
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:07,172
I intend to follow the rules.

795
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:24,172
Excuse me, Mr. President.

796
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,964
The Security Command
is asking for the General.

797
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:28,714
Who is?

798
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:36,629
Sir, please stay low.

799
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,588
Is the Chief in there?
What's his location?

800
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:41,130
It seems like he's
not in there anymore.

801
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:42,131
What?

802
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:45,047
Hold your fire! Stop!

803
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,921
Why are they shooting at us?

804
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:50,212
33rd MPs and Marine Guards
are exchanging fire inside,

805
00:54:50,213 --> 00:54:52,629
and the MPs say they came as backup...

806
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,046
The Marines claim

807
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:57,922
that the MPs took the
Chief away by force.

808
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:01,879
Since when did they
have so many guards?

809
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,547
Halt!

810
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:10,422
They're here to get me, these bastards.

811
00:55:11,006 --> 00:55:13,672
Turn off the engine, please.

812
00:55:13,755 --> 00:55:15,630
I said, turn it off.

813
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:20,796
Turn it off.

814
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:22,838
We have the Commander's car.

815
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:24,005
<i>Good.</i>

816
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:26,255
Disarm and arrest them immediately.

817
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:29,047
General, come.

818
00:55:30,213 --> 00:55:31,379
General Kim.

819
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,130
Listen, we have to arrest
the Security Commander.

820
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:40,839
Go.

821
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,463
Go now.

822
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:47,089
- The gate's closed.
- Hurry, damn it!

823
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:54,171
All personnel, step out of the car.

824
00:55:54,255 --> 00:55:57,714
Captain, do you know who's in the back?

825
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,046
Yes, step out please.

826
00:56:00,047 --> 00:56:02,171
Driver first.

827
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:04,255
Out of the car, now!

828
00:56:09,964 --> 00:56:11,629
Move away from the car.

829
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,838
Come forward.

830
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:14,505
Step out.

831
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,338
Step out, now.

832
00:56:28,922 --> 00:56:29,714
Yes, sir.

833
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:32,629
This is the Vice Chief of
Staff. What's the situation?

834
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,547
We have the Commander's vehicle,

835
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,170
and we're about to arrest him, sir.

836
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:38,088
What, arrest him?

837
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,672
Wait.

838
00:56:40,006 --> 00:56:43,212
Look, don't arrest him.
Just tell him to wait there.

839
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:44,964
But it's the Provost Marshal's order.

840
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:47,713
Who do you think I was just briefed by?

841
00:56:47,714 --> 00:56:49,171
<i>Do as I say.</i>

842
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:52,881
We must arrest him right now.

843
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:55,297
Wait, Captain!

844
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,629
Hold up!

845
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:59,713
The General stays
inside? Are we standing by?

846
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:01,046
Commander!

847
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:03,088
It's the Vice Chief of Staff.

848
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:09,629
- Yes?
- <i>General.</i>

849
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,796
You ordered the arrest
without my permission?

850
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:15,421
Sir, to find out where the Chief is...

851
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:19,797
Don't you know we need the consent
of the martial law commander first?

852
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:24,129
How can we do that
when he's the one taken?

853
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:25,754
That doesn't give you an excuse.

854
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:29,796
Chun called me, the Provost Marshal,
the Special Warfare Commander tonight,

855
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:32,462
<i>and raided the Chief's
residence at the same time.</i>

856
00:57:32,463 --> 00:57:34,129
<i>To rescue the Chief,</i>

857
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,713
we must arrest Chun and...

858
00:57:35,714 --> 00:57:37,881
Listen to me, General.

859
00:57:37,964 --> 00:57:41,421
Don't jump to conclusions.
We could all get in trouble.

860
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:43,588
Just don't stir things up.

861
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:47,088
- Sir, I didn't start this.
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

862
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,171
Sir, please. We can't let this happen!

863
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:52,713
This is all a plot by Chun and Hanahoe.

864
00:57:52,714 --> 00:57:54,213
Gosh...

865
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,463
I'm the one to judge here.

866
00:57:57,547 --> 00:58:00,547
I'll take care of it, okay?

867
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,380
Get him to open the gate.

868
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,755
You two open the gate.

869
00:58:09,213 --> 00:58:10,213
Sir?

870
00:58:10,672 --> 00:58:12,088
Open the gate.

871
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:15,672
Move away from the vehicle.

872
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:17,963
Move now!

873
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:23,922
Captain!

874
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,172
Captain! Come here.

875
00:58:26,255 --> 00:58:28,464
Yes, sir. Eyes on them.

876
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,963
I need you to open the gate.

877
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:43,421
Lt. Colonel? Stop!

878
00:58:43,422 --> 00:58:44,630
Get out of the car!

879
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:46,338
Your gun...

880
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:50,547
Lt. Colonel! Turn off the car! Get out!

881
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:54,213
- Should we?
- Go now, you idiot!

882
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:58,630
Floor it!

883
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:11,505
Sir, are you all right?

884
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:15,297
Me?

885
00:59:15,714 --> 00:59:17,213
I'm fine.

886
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:21,505
Take me to 30th Security.

887
00:59:22,338 --> 00:59:23,713
He got away?

888
00:59:23,714 --> 00:59:25,464
I'm sorry, General.

889
00:59:25,756 --> 00:59:28,213
How could you lose him?

890
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,881
Hey, it's me.

891
00:59:31,297 --> 00:59:34,546
You're in no position to say that.

892
00:59:34,547 --> 00:59:37,546
Isn't 30th Security under your command?

893
00:59:37,547 --> 00:59:38,546
Yes, it is.

894
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:41,046
Chun Doo-gwang, Roh Tae-gun,

895
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:45,630
and the whole gang were
gathered there since this afternoon.

896
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:48,756
How could you not know
that as its commander?

897
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:51,839
Do your job first
before you lecture us.

898
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:57,255
We can't wait any longer.
Declare DEFCON 1.

899
00:59:57,338 --> 00:59:58,297
- Lt. Colonel.
- Yes?

900
00:59:58,298 --> 01:00:00,087
Follow my orders exactly!

901
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:02,129
Those 33rd MPs inside,

902
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,380
they came to abduct the
Chief and got stuck there.

903
01:00:05,464 --> 01:00:08,421
Put two APCs close together,
and push your way in with Marines.

904
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:10,756
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

905
01:00:10,921 --> 01:00:12,797
Have all COs report to...

906
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:15,505
This is the Commander.

907
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,255
Issue arrest orders for Jang
Min-gi, Won Gyung and Jin Young-do.

908
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:23,047
You have permission
to fire if they resist.

909
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:26,005
Yes, open fire!

910
01:00:26,547 --> 01:00:27,921
Shoot them!

911
01:00:28,547 --> 01:00:30,756
The criminals who abducted
the Martial Law Commander

912
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:33,671
- <i>are gathered in the 30th Security</i>
- They can hear too?

913
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:34,755
What's going on?

914
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,880
<i>and ignoring their superiors' command.</i>

915
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:44,504
Our military condemn this action
as a coup d'état led by the DSC,

916
01:00:44,505 --> 01:00:46,838
and name the B2 Bunker
as command center,

917
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:49,672
<i>as we're now in a state of war.</i>

918
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:56,088
Today at 20:20, I declare

919
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:58,963
<i>DEFCON 1 to all forces.</i>

920
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:04,880
- Captain, move your men out!
- Yes, sir!

921
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:05,921
Move!

922
01:01:05,922 --> 01:01:08,338
They want us to send back the Chief?

923
01:01:08,339 --> 01:01:10,631
It was a lost cause from the start.

924
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:12,755
Shit!

925
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:15,505
I told you this would happen.

926
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:16,755
Yeah...

927
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,880
We need to keep calm, especially now.

928
01:01:20,714 --> 01:01:23,963
Where's Chun? Did he get the approval?

929
01:01:28,005 --> 01:01:30,047
I don't have the damn approval yet.

930
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:33,172
Sir.

931
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:35,213
Don't worry.

932
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:38,880
We just need to find
the Minister of Defense.

933
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:42,963
Chun, did you not hear what happened?

934
01:01:43,047 --> 01:01:45,296
How could you let it come to this?

935
01:01:45,297 --> 01:01:46,922
Come to what?

936
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,547
You heard we successfully
arrested Chief Jeong.

937
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:52,921
Doo-gwang!

938
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:54,254
Yes, what?

939
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:58,088
They declared DEFCON 1.
Now we're guilty of treason.

940
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,795
All of us are finished!

941
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:05,338
Seriously, gentleman.
Did you not expect this?

942
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:09,547
Fail and it's treason,
succeed and it's revolution!

943
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,005
We're only...

944
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,464
What time is it?

945
01:02:18,047 --> 01:02:20,255
It's been only 98 minutes.

946
01:02:20,505 --> 01:02:22,880
You want to surrender without a fight?

947
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:28,838
You, go find the Minister.

948
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:32,047
Get our men to drag his ass over here.

949
01:02:40,963 --> 01:02:43,214
Look here, Minister.

950
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:53,963
Why come here instead of your office?

951
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:57,422
We can't do anything
for you at this moment.

952
01:03:05,464 --> 01:03:09,589
The North can take this chance
to attack us, don't you think?

953
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,962
We're using all our resources
to locate the Minister,

954
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:24,338
so we'll find him soon.

955
01:03:24,339 --> 01:03:27,339
Where the hell did he run off to?

956
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:28,754
He's supposed to be
Minister of Defense...

957
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:31,796
- Where is he?
- Hiding somewhere.

958
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:34,713
Jang speaking.

959
01:03:34,714 --> 01:03:38,671
<i>What are you doing there?
Didn't you get my order?</i>

960
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:40,547
Can someone...

961
01:03:40,631 --> 01:03:41,879
answer this please?

962
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,713
- Who is it?
- The CGC Commander.

963
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,214
Answer me.

964
01:03:48,297 --> 01:03:49,379
Sir...

965
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,463
Answer me!

966
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:51,755
You do it.

967
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:55,962
Lee, this is Han.

968
01:03:55,963 --> 01:03:58,422
What are you doing there?

969
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,338
That's my unit there.

970
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:02,087
I know.

971
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,047
Why don't you come over here,

972
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,712
and listen to General Chun?

973
01:04:05,713 --> 01:04:07,547
Is he there?

974
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:08,880
<i>Put him on the phone.</i>

975
01:04:08,963 --> 01:04:10,838
I have something to say to him.

976
01:04:12,589 --> 01:04:14,088
He wants you.

977
01:04:16,005 --> 01:04:18,671
<i>Chun, I know you can hear me.</i>

978
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,671
Bring the Chief back
to the Army HQ now.

979
01:04:23,922 --> 01:04:25,213
And all of you idiots,

980
01:04:25,214 --> 01:04:28,171
<i>you know 30th Security
is under my command.</i>

981
01:04:28,172 --> 01:04:30,797
<i>So return to your unit.</i>

982
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,172
<i>Especially my men, Jang, Won and Jin,</i>

983
01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:35,880
report to me right now.

984
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:38,463
Lee, please calm down.

985
01:04:38,464 --> 01:04:40,214
Who is this?

986
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:44,588
This is Lt. Gen. Bae, okay?

987
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:46,670
We too are concerned
about this country...

988
01:04:46,671 --> 01:04:49,547
You brainless piece of shit.

989
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:54,129
- Is that why you staged a coup?
- Watch it, Lee.

990
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,713
All of you stay right there.

991
01:04:57,255 --> 01:05:00,755
I'll bring tanks myself and
crush your fucking skulls.

992
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,464
Shit.

993
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:19,921
How typical of his background.
He's got a dirty mouth.

994
01:05:19,922 --> 01:05:21,838
How can you laugh?

995
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:24,922
His troops are only an hour from here.

996
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,464
If we don't resolve this,
it'll be our graveyard.

997
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:32,505
Graveyard, my ass.
Keep your mouth shut.

998
01:05:32,506 --> 01:05:33,339
What?

999
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:34,463
Hee-chul.

1000
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:35,797
Yes, sir.

1001
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:39,422
I need the 2nd Airborne.

1002
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,630
- Pardon?
- Hold on.

1003
01:05:41,713 --> 01:05:45,754
Once we involve Airbornes,
there's no turning back.

1004
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,046
We'll go to war then.

1005
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:49,797
That's different from
arresting the Chief.

1006
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,214
The war already began
when we made that arrest.

1007
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:56,005
Lee's coming here with tanks.

1008
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:59,255
He doesn't make empty threats.

1009
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:03,963
You want to die here?
Or take over Seoul first?

1010
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:05,880
Commander Roh!

1011
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:08,504
My troops must hold the front line.

1012
01:06:08,505 --> 01:06:10,922
Tonight, this is the front line.

1013
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:14,296
If Lee gets the upper
hand, we're finished.

1014
01:06:14,297 --> 01:06:15,712
Listen,

1015
01:06:15,713 --> 01:06:19,213
what if the North invades while
the border is left unguarded?

1016
01:06:19,214 --> 01:06:23,213
Kim Il-sung has no plan to
invade tonight. Trust me.

1017
01:06:23,214 --> 01:06:24,880
Why trust you?

1018
01:06:24,963 --> 01:06:26,046
We got into this mess...

1019
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:27,505
Brother!

1020
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,588
Tell me, Commander Roh!

1021
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:39,755
Move!

1022
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,964
Their defense will be hard to break.

1023
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,462
But we have the authority to command

1024
01:06:51,463 --> 01:06:54,297
the 26th and 30th Divisions
in the North and the West.

1025
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:57,546
The problem is the Airbornes
that joined the rebels.

1026
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:02,588
The 2nd, 6th and 4th Airbornes
are led by Hanahoe key figures.

1027
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:06,381
Not only are they close to Seoul,
they're fast and highly capable.

1028
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:08,922
The 8th Airborne Brigadier
isn't one of them.

1029
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:11,046
He's an OCS graduate like me.

1030
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:12,922
First, mobilize the 8th Airborne.

1031
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:15,964
We'll also bring the 30th
and 26th Divisions into Seoul,

1032
01:07:16,047 --> 01:07:19,421
while asking the Third Corps
for the Mechanized Infantry.

1033
01:07:19,505 --> 01:07:23,339
Then, the enemy will be cut off.

1034
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,546
And the Tank Corps? Any news yet?

1035
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,921
I spoke to its commander,
but he's Hanahoe.

1036
01:07:28,922 --> 01:07:30,463
He won't budge.

1037
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,381
- Gimpo Field Artillery.
- Yes.

1038
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,088
Any Hanahoe members there?

1039
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:39,381
There's none. You
have their loyalty, sir.

1040
01:07:39,463 --> 01:07:40,672
Good.

1041
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:44,713
Tell me, who's with Hanahoe here?

1042
01:07:54,672 --> 01:08:00,713
What a bunch of
feeble-minded cowards...

1043
01:08:04,005 --> 01:08:06,297
You too!

1044
01:08:07,005 --> 01:08:08,672
You wimp.

1045
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:12,463
Don't give me that.

1046
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,547
I trusted you with my life!

1047
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,755
How could you say that to me?

1048
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,964
Exactly...

1049
01:08:23,256 --> 01:08:26,130
My point exactly, you idiot.

1050
01:08:26,214 --> 01:08:29,005
That's why I'm asking for your help.

1051
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:38,463
General Roh.

1052
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:42,005
Let's go back in.

1053
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:52,089
I'm not a coward.

1054
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,839
You know that, right?

1055
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:59,172
Come on.

1056
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:06,797
I made my decision.

1057
01:09:07,922 --> 01:09:12,005
The train's running at full
steam. Who wants to jump out?

1058
01:09:13,005 --> 01:09:14,713
My 9th Division...

1059
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:18,172
- will send in two regiments.
- What?

1060
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:27,587
If you want out, now's the time.

1061
01:09:27,588 --> 01:09:32,672
When this door closes,
you're with me to the end.

1062
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:58,047
General Chun.

1063
01:09:58,463 --> 01:10:00,755
What can we do for you?

1064
01:10:06,839 --> 01:10:09,172
Let's leave Roh in charge here,

1065
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:13,214
and go back to the
President for the approval.

1066
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,964
- Destination Capitol Hall. Move.
- <i>Sir.</i>

1067
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:22,879
Is it right to pull back
our men from the front?

1068
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,379
If there's a war tonight,
it'll be here, understand?

1069
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,131
I don't understand, sir.

1070
01:10:29,422 --> 01:10:32,463
How can we pull back
the frontline unit?

1071
01:10:32,547 --> 01:10:33,880
General Kim...

1072
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,838
How many times do I have to tell you?

1073
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:39,463
The North won't invade!

1074
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:43,172
Just... trust me on this.

1075
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:47,004
We're lucky the
capital's top commanders

1076
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:49,005
are all on our side.

1077
01:10:49,505 --> 01:10:51,296
We're surely at an advantage.

1078
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,005
How dare they...

1079
01:10:53,797 --> 01:10:54,879
That's right.

1080
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,004
General,

1081
01:10:56,005 --> 01:11:00,004
we can try talking to
them and stall for time.

1082
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,588
Then they'll be exhausted
and give up the fight...

1083
01:11:02,672 --> 01:11:06,963
Sir, what are you talking
about? We need to react quickly!

1084
01:11:06,964 --> 01:11:08,337
You scared me.

1085
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:13,797
General, you don't have to
yell at me in front of everyone.

1086
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:19,296
Sir, are you sure about this?

1087
01:11:21,463 --> 01:11:23,172
Want me to do it for you?

1088
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,171
Yeah, it's me.

1089
01:11:30,296 --> 01:11:33,588
Get everyone armed. We're moving out.

1090
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:37,296
Get your shit together
and open your ears!

1091
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:39,714
The destination is...

1092
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:44,255
Army HQ in Samgakji.

1093
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:48,588
The 2nd and 4th Airborne
aren't responding?

1094
01:11:51,755 --> 01:11:54,046
Sir, CGC Commander's on the line.

1095
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:56,587
They're all in it
together. Don't trust them.

1096
01:11:56,588 --> 01:11:59,463
<i>They're all moving in unison now.</i>

1097
01:11:59,547 --> 01:12:01,754
<i>So, I need you to send 8th Airborne</i>

1098
01:12:01,755 --> 01:12:04,212
to the 30th Security immediately.

1099
01:12:04,213 --> 01:12:07,462
8th Airborne is now returning
to its base after training…

1100
01:12:07,463 --> 01:12:09,839
Call them in right now!

1101
01:12:09,922 --> 01:12:11,587
This is a greatly urgent matter.

1102
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:12,838
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

1103
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,171
I'll do as you say.

1104
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:20,089
Major Oh, still no response
from 2nd and 4th Airborne?

1105
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:21,964
General.

1106
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,547
The 2nd Airborne is coming to Seoul.

1107
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,964
What?

1108
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:36,588
Sir, this is Major Oh.

1109
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:39,379
Please respond.

1110
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,337
<i>The Commander's ordered
you to return immediately.</i>

1111
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:45,547
One says to move out,
the other, to return...

1112
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,630
- What the hell is going on?
- <i>Sir.</i>

1113
01:12:48,714 --> 01:12:49,913
- Should I turn it off?
- <i>Sir!</i>

1114
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:54,880
It's on its way here?

1115
01:12:54,964 --> 01:12:56,297
15 km away, sir.

1116
01:12:57,255 --> 01:12:58,006
2nd Airborne?

1117
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:00,422
What was the Special
Warfare Commander doing?

1118
01:13:00,505 --> 01:13:02,296
Hanahoe must have given the order.

1119
01:13:02,297 --> 01:13:05,088
The situation in CGC is no different.

1120
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:08,171
- That's outrageous!
- They'll be here any minute.

1121
01:13:08,255 --> 01:13:10,462
We have no defense
force here. What do we do?

1122
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:13,379
Sir, we need a strong offensive action.

1123
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,963
Like what?

1124
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:19,296
Muster all available forces
and send them out now!

1125
01:13:19,297 --> 01:13:22,672
How dare they do this
under an elected president?

1126
01:13:22,755 --> 01:13:25,380
What did the Minister say?

1127
01:13:25,463 --> 01:13:27,296
<i>We can't reach him.</i>

1128
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:31,838
Abducting the army chief of staff
is clearly an act of insurrection.

1129
01:13:31,839 --> 01:13:32,963
<i>You're right.</i>

1130
01:13:32,964 --> 01:13:36,213
I can't agree more. They're imbeciles!

1131
01:13:36,297 --> 01:13:38,338
To stop the 2nd Airborne,

1132
01:13:38,422 --> 01:13:41,589
we need the Mechanized
Infantry and 26th Division.

1133
01:13:42,463 --> 01:13:46,129
All right. I'll give
them the orders now.

1134
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,212
I'm counting on you.

1135
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:50,006
Sure, don't worry.

1136
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:54,839
The Mechanized Infantry
won't make it in time

1137
01:13:54,922 --> 01:13:56,754
to stop the 2nd Airborne
crossing the river.

1138
01:13:56,755 --> 01:13:59,421
Sir, they are incredibly fast.

1139
01:13:59,422 --> 01:14:01,088
Hold on, let me think.

1140
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:03,422
Those bastards...

1141
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,630
For them to enter Seoul...

1142
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:16,754
They must come through here.
Over the 2nd Hangang Bridge,

1143
01:14:16,755 --> 01:14:18,629
maybe the Seoul Bridge,

1144
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,422
or they'll go the long way around

1145
01:14:20,505 --> 01:14:22,672
and cross the 1st Hangang Bridge.

1146
01:14:22,755 --> 01:14:27,881
But it'd require a division to
block all Han River bridges.

1147
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,922
No.

1148
01:14:30,589 --> 01:14:32,755
We're not blocking them.

1149
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:35,755
The citizens will.

1150
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:39,839
Close all bridges in
my area of command.

1151
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:42,088
Both directions entirely.

1152
01:14:44,964 --> 01:14:45,964
Stop the car.

1153
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,881
All vehicles, halt!

1154
01:14:58,839 --> 01:15:01,297
Just push through them.
Or go against the traffic!

1155
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,463
- Take the opposite lane.
- Give me a smoke.

1156
01:15:03,464 --> 01:15:06,379
Who follows traffic
laws in a war situation?

1157
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,172
The opposite lanes are
jammed with civilian cars too.

1158
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,796
They can take 1st Hangang
Bridge or Seoul Bridge.

1159
01:15:12,797 --> 01:15:16,797
From here to 3rd Hangang
Bridge, all bridges are blocked.

1160
01:15:17,088 --> 01:15:18,755
Haengju Bridge.

1161
01:15:19,464 --> 01:15:21,172
CGC doesn't control this one.

1162
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:22,046
That's right.

1163
01:15:22,047 --> 01:15:25,839
<i>General, Haengju Bridge is
under your command, isn't it?</i>

1164
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:29,171
I need you to block the
bridge to hinder their advance.

1165
01:15:29,172 --> 01:15:30,796
I understand.

1166
01:15:30,797 --> 01:15:33,672
We'll bolster security
and cut off the passage.

1167
01:15:33,755 --> 01:15:37,005
If needed, I can back you
up with our artillery brigade.

1168
01:15:37,088 --> 01:15:38,504
No, it's fine.

1169
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:42,088
We have two companies
arriving shortly, fully armed.

1170
01:15:42,172 --> 01:15:43,714
Give us some time.

1171
01:15:43,797 --> 01:15:45,172
Thank you.

1172
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:48,254
Everyone heard that?

1173
01:15:48,255 --> 01:15:50,421
If this bridge is
blocked, we're screwed.

1174
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:53,297
If the Airborne doesn't
cross, you'll be jailed for life.

1175
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,630
Use all your connections
in the 30th Division

1176
01:15:55,714 --> 01:15:58,338
and find a way for me
to talk to its commander.

1177
01:15:58,672 --> 01:16:03,464
Tonight, it all comes down to
whose troops enter Seoul first.

1178
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,920
They'll block all lanes
and set up machine guns.

1179
01:16:05,921 --> 01:16:07,714
Okay, good.

1180
01:16:12,714 --> 01:16:13,547
Yes.

1181
01:16:13,548 --> 01:16:16,755
Commander, this is
the DSC Chief Secretary.

1182
01:16:16,756 --> 01:16:20,547
I'm calling about the conversation
you just had with General Lee.

1183
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:22,547
Who the hell are you?

1184
01:16:23,547 --> 01:16:25,087
How'd you hear our conversation?

1185
01:16:25,088 --> 01:16:28,588
Let's just say we have
ears all over the network.

1186
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:30,504
You'll be sorry you said that.

1187
01:16:30,505 --> 01:16:33,422
- <i>What's your name and rank?</i>
- The odds are against you.

1188
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,337
9th Division's on its
way. 4th Airborne, too.

1189
01:16:36,338 --> 01:16:39,171
Even if you block the bridge,
it's only a matter of time.

1190
01:16:39,172 --> 01:16:41,088
You fucking idiot!

1191
01:16:41,172 --> 01:16:44,171
You pulled back the frontline unit?

1192
01:16:44,172 --> 01:16:47,797
- <i>Have you lost it?</i>
- Many generals have already...

1193
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,171
joined this great cause.

1194
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:50,088
Damn you...

1195
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:54,630
I'll keep listening for the
wise decision you'll take.

1196
01:17:04,963 --> 01:17:06,172
Quickly!

1197
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:12,547
- You bastard!
- Son of a bitch!

1198
01:17:12,797 --> 01:17:15,088
- Disarm them!
- Bastards!

1199
01:17:35,422 --> 01:17:37,129
Attention!

1200
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,212
Salute the President!

1201
01:17:39,213 --> 01:17:41,088
Allegiance!

1202
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:42,714
Order arms!

1203
01:17:44,005 --> 01:17:47,338
You seem busy tonight, General.

1204
01:17:47,339 --> 01:17:50,005
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1205
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:51,838
The reason why we're here is...

1206
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:57,714
What did you do to the Chief
that soldiers are being shot?

1207
01:17:59,047 --> 01:18:01,795
There was a small
disturbance, but as you can see,

1208
01:18:01,796 --> 01:18:05,212
the whole army is supporting the arrest

1209
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,379
and the investigation of Chief Jeong.

1210
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,756
So...

1211
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:13,921
Do you have the Minister's consent?

1212
01:18:15,213 --> 01:18:18,296
How could you arrest
the martial law commander

1213
01:18:18,297 --> 01:18:19,920
without due process?

1214
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:22,338
Lt. Gen. Han Young-gu,
if I may, Mr. President.

1215
01:18:22,339 --> 01:18:24,171
If you delay the approval,

1216
01:18:24,172 --> 01:18:28,172
the situation could escalate
into civil war in no time.

1217
01:18:28,796 --> 01:18:30,380
Civil war?

1218
01:18:56,838 --> 01:18:58,422
Hey, Captain.

1219
01:18:58,505 --> 01:19:01,171
I'm from CGC. Where's the control line?

1220
01:19:01,172 --> 01:19:03,796
We were ordered to stand down.

1221
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:07,463
It's your commander's
order. Set up barricades now.

1222
01:19:07,464 --> 01:19:10,005
We were ordered by the commander too.

1223
01:19:11,589 --> 01:19:13,922
- You sure it was him?
- Yes, sir.

1224
01:19:14,005 --> 01:19:16,214
There was a mix-up in communication,

1225
01:19:16,297 --> 01:19:18,588
but I can explain it to the Army HQ.

1226
01:19:18,589 --> 01:19:21,546
We need your approval first, though.

1227
01:19:21,547 --> 01:19:22,755
Enough!

1228
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:25,440
Mr. President already told you
to get the Minister's consent first!

1229
01:19:25,464 --> 01:19:29,546
Prime Minister, he's gone
missing. What do you want us to do?

1230
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:33,963
So, you threaten the
President with talk of civil war?

1231
01:19:34,047 --> 01:19:36,380
We never threatened him!

1232
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:39,631
How can they be so obtuse...

1233
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:44,130
General, what's that attitude?

1234
01:19:44,214 --> 01:19:46,464
We're not bullies, are we?

1235
01:19:48,506 --> 01:19:52,047
Mr. President, forgive
our rude behavior.

1236
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:58,422
I've made myself clear.

1237
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:00,963
You're dismissed.

1238
01:20:05,506 --> 01:20:08,297
Shit.

1239
01:20:16,005 --> 01:20:19,339
We'll wait until you approve this.

1240
01:20:22,922 --> 01:20:24,506
Why did you tell them to stand down?

1241
01:20:24,589 --> 01:20:27,589
I was just informed by
Janggok Checkpoint

1242
01:20:27,671 --> 01:20:29,670
that the 9th Division is coming.

1243
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:30,506
What?

1244
01:20:30,507 --> 01:20:32,962
This is more serious than I thought.

1245
01:20:32,963 --> 01:20:36,962
Plus, we can't have all-out
war with 2nd Airborne...

1246
01:20:36,963 --> 01:20:39,213
That's why we need to stop them.

1247
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:42,129
If we don't do anything, they'll
march straight to Army HQ.

1248
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:45,255
What can we do when
they're listening to our calls?

1249
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,922
I'm sorry.

1250
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:54,963
General Roh called
in his frontline troops.

1251
01:20:55,047 --> 01:20:57,546
How can they leave us
exposed to the North?

1252
01:20:57,547 --> 01:20:59,797
They must fear Chun
more than Kim Il-sung.

1253
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,547
I'm more worried about
DSC listening in on our calls.

1254
01:21:07,255 --> 01:21:09,087
<i>Attention, all soldiers.</i>

1255
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:12,588
The following men may be shot on sight.

1256
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:14,505
Turn it up.

1257
01:21:14,506 --> 01:21:19,630
<i>Gen. Chun, Gen. Roh, Bae, Han and Do,</i>

1258
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:26,089
<i>and convicted CGC officers
Col. Jang, Jin and Won,</i>

1259
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:29,255
<i>DSC officers Moon, Ha and Lim</i>

1260
01:21:29,339 --> 01:21:33,296
<i>and anyone giving them aid...</i>

1261
01:21:33,297 --> 01:21:35,837
Where's the 2nd Airborne?

1262
01:21:35,838 --> 01:21:38,588
Sir, I did what I could.

1263
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,880
You little shit, answer me.

1264
01:21:43,214 --> 01:21:45,713
Did they cross the bridge or not?

1265
01:21:45,922 --> 01:21:47,547
Colonel!

1266
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:50,547
Bring the barricades! Hurry!

1267
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:53,755
You two bring those, now!

1268
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,380
<i>An update from Haengju Bridge.</i>

1269
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:05,129
2nd Airborne is at the bridge.

1270
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,629
They'll be crossing any minute.

1271
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:08,880
Good.

1272
01:22:09,506 --> 01:22:11,047
Shouldn't take long, right?

1273
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:18,506
<i>Colonel.</i>

1274
01:22:18,671 --> 01:22:20,506
<i>This is the Vice Chief of Staff.</i>

1275
01:22:20,588 --> 01:22:22,339
Return to base immediately.

1276
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:24,629
<i>The moment you cross the bridge,</i>

1277
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,339
<i>we have no choice but to engage.</i>

1278
01:22:26,381 --> 01:22:28,047
<i>If it results in casualties,</i>

1279
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:32,005
<i>I'll court-martial all of
you to maximum penalties!</i>

1280
01:22:34,838 --> 01:22:37,464
They're not going to stop.

1281
01:22:38,089 --> 01:22:40,339
They're on the bridge!

1282
01:22:41,546 --> 01:22:42,797
Wait!

1283
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,546
Hey, what's that?

1284
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,214
What is he doing there?

1285
01:22:55,464 --> 01:22:57,297
Please turn back.

1286
01:23:26,588 --> 01:23:29,088
Sir, he's a two-star.

1287
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:30,837
- Run him over.
- Sir?

1288
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:32,505
Just hit the gas!

1289
01:23:33,047 --> 01:23:36,505
What if they really court-martial us?

1290
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,630
Let's check first.

1291
01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:43,588
<i>This is your Commander.</i>

1292
01:23:44,214 --> 01:23:46,380
2nd Airborne, turn around.

1293
01:23:46,381 --> 01:23:51,047
Return to base, and
no one will be punished.

1294
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,381
If you enter Seoul,

1295
01:23:53,713 --> 01:23:56,505
it's all-out war, understand?

1296
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:00,130
Return to your base now.

1297
01:24:04,089 --> 01:24:06,504
Who's blocking them? 30th Division?

1298
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:08,088
I'm not sure.

1299
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,462
It's... it's one man.

1300
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:11,463
One?

1301
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:14,587
- Just one?
- What the hell? Give it to me.

1302
01:24:14,588 --> 01:24:16,796
- What's going on?
- Give me the fucking phone!

1303
01:24:16,797 --> 01:24:20,046
There's a man standing
in the middle of the bridge.

1304
01:24:20,047 --> 01:24:21,545
Yes, General.

1305
01:24:21,546 --> 01:24:23,421
They've stopped in the middle.

1306
01:24:24,546 --> 01:24:26,880
Huh? They're turning back.

1307
01:24:27,588 --> 01:24:30,421
They are going back
south of the bridge!

1308
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:34,421
Are they taking fire?

1309
01:24:34,505 --> 01:24:37,463
- <i>No, they're not.</i>
- Then why?

1310
01:24:37,546 --> 01:24:38,629
Why?

1311
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:41,172
How dare he disobey my order!

1312
01:24:44,463 --> 01:24:48,504
You're absolutely sure
they're going back?

1313
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,089
I'm watching it now.

1314
01:25:06,256 --> 01:25:07,964
2nd Airborne has turned back.

1315
01:25:11,838 --> 01:25:13,796
We still must keep our guard up!

1316
01:25:13,797 --> 01:25:15,172
Get me something to drink.

1317
01:25:15,713 --> 01:25:17,963
That old fart.

1318
01:25:17,964 --> 01:25:20,796
2nd Airborne's turning
back from Haengju Bridge.

1319
01:25:20,797 --> 01:25:23,004
Goddammit! Who ordered it?

1320
01:25:23,005 --> 01:25:27,005
Lee was blocking the bridge,
and the Army HQ got to them.

1321
01:25:27,463 --> 01:25:30,005
Those sons of bitches...

1322
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:34,712
Is Do Hee-chul still
at the 30th Security?

1323
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:35,713
Yes, sir.

1324
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,672
Hee-chul.

1325
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:47,713
My brother, Hee-chul.

1326
01:25:48,297 --> 01:25:49,880
What's going on, sir?

1327
01:25:50,297 --> 01:25:52,213
You go there yourself, okay?

1328
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:56,463
Go bring the 2nd Airborne. All of them.

1329
01:25:59,214 --> 01:26:00,880
You're kidding.

1330
01:26:04,256 --> 01:26:05,880
Did you laugh?

1331
01:26:05,964 --> 01:26:07,463
What the hell?

1332
01:26:08,547 --> 01:26:11,213
- You think I'm kidding?
- Sir, stop.

1333
01:26:11,214 --> 01:26:12,380
Sir!

1334
01:26:13,755 --> 01:26:15,796
What are you doing?

1335
01:26:15,797 --> 01:26:18,295
I'm not shooting. Let me go!

1336
01:26:18,296 --> 01:26:21,256
Hee-chul, come here. Come right here!

1337
01:26:21,964 --> 01:26:23,463
Grab the gun.

1338
01:26:23,547 --> 01:26:25,421
Grab it!

1339
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:29,797
If you don't want to go,

1340
01:26:30,214 --> 01:26:32,797
shoot right through my heart.

1341
01:26:34,964 --> 01:26:36,214
Shoot me!

1342
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,296
I want you to start making
calls using all your connections!

1343
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,839
Stop them from making any move.

1344
01:26:43,922 --> 01:26:47,214
If we fail, we'll lose this war.

1345
01:27:06,214 --> 01:27:07,588
Take it.

1346
01:27:08,797 --> 01:27:10,755
Let me ask one thing.

1347
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:14,922
Are you sure Chief Jeong is safe?

1348
01:27:15,255 --> 01:27:19,337
Floor it! He told me to
bring our men at once!

1349
01:27:19,338 --> 01:27:22,839
General Chun asked me! Of all people!

1350
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:28,505
Kang, turn the car around.

1351
01:27:29,131 --> 01:27:31,422
I need to go to Third Corps myself.

1352
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,379
- What are you doing here?
- Pardon?

1353
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,338
Go back out there.

1354
01:27:46,339 --> 01:27:49,921
I just got the radio. The
Commander ordered us here.

1355
01:27:49,922 --> 01:27:51,796
- Did you laugh?
- Sorry?

1356
01:27:51,797 --> 01:27:53,505
Did you just laugh at me?

1357
01:27:54,213 --> 01:27:55,921
No, sir. I didn't laugh.

1358
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:58,421
- You just did, you bastard.
- What's wrong?

1359
01:27:58,422 --> 01:28:00,504
Grab it. Grab it!

1360
01:28:00,505 --> 01:28:02,546
Please calm down!

1361
01:28:02,547 --> 01:28:03,671
Jeez, you shit.

1362
01:28:03,672 --> 01:28:05,796
- Just grab it.
- Sir, please!

1363
01:28:05,797 --> 01:28:09,964
If you want to disobey
me, just shoot me right here.

1364
01:28:19,296 --> 01:28:20,880
Hee-chul did it!

1365
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,797
2nd Airborne is moving out again.

1366
01:28:28,255 --> 01:28:31,296
You think people like to give orders?

1367
01:28:31,463 --> 01:28:33,131
What?

1368
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:36,630
You know, all human beings

1369
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:41,755
want someone strong to lead them.

1370
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:44,922
Everyone is waiting.

1371
01:28:45,006 --> 01:28:47,089
Those guys in there,

1372
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:51,338
they're hoping to eat
some crumbs off the table.

1373
01:28:53,839 --> 01:29:01,171
I'll shove plenty down their throats!

1374
01:29:19,839 --> 01:29:22,463
You don't need to come here.

1375
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:25,504
Our commanding officers
don't wish to intervene.

1376
01:29:25,505 --> 01:29:26,838
<i>Commander</i>,

1377
01:29:26,839 --> 01:29:30,338
at least send your battalion
units to the Army HQ please.

1378
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:34,087
General, haven't you heard?

1379
01:29:34,088 --> 01:29:37,254
<i>I was just informed too.</i>

1380
01:29:37,255 --> 01:29:40,170
2nd Airborne is coming back.

1381
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:41,463
What?

1382
01:29:42,589 --> 01:29:46,588
<i>I'll try to convince my men.</i>

1383
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:50,588
But don't get your hopes up. Goodbye.

1384
01:29:50,589 --> 01:29:51,964
Commander!

1385
01:30:14,213 --> 01:30:15,547
Brigadier General!

1386
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,046
A call for you, sir.

1387
01:30:17,422 --> 01:30:19,589
- Is it the DSC again?
- The CGC Commander, sir.

1388
01:30:22,672 --> 01:30:25,505
<i>- Park, speaking.</i>
- This is Lee Tae-shin.

1389
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:31,713
- Brigadier, I know you have a lot...
- Sir, get to the point.

1390
01:30:31,714 --> 01:30:35,422
Mobilize 8th Airborne to Seoul, please.

1391
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,380
These are Airbornes
you're talking about.

1392
01:30:39,589 --> 01:30:42,130
If we engage 2nd Airborne,

1393
01:30:42,213 --> 01:30:43,796
<i>that'll be all-out war.</i>

1394
01:30:43,797 --> 01:30:47,463
That's exactly why I need
you to come before they do.

1395
01:30:47,547 --> 01:30:49,505
Why the 8th Airborne?

1396
01:30:49,589 --> 01:30:52,046
Why do we have to take the lead?

1397
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:55,714
2nd, 4th, 6th Airbornes
are in Hanahoe's control.

1398
01:30:55,797 --> 01:30:59,255
We are greatly outnumbered.

1399
01:31:00,964 --> 01:31:02,589
Brigadier.

1400
01:31:02,672 --> 01:31:06,337
Only the 8th Airborne
can enter Seoul in time.

1401
01:31:06,338 --> 01:31:09,338
- That's why I'm asking...
<i>- Please stop.</i>

1402
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:12,213
8th Airborne will stay out of it.

1403
01:31:12,797 --> 01:31:16,088
If you come first to
establish a defense line

1404
01:31:16,172 --> 01:31:18,504
<i>and strike the 30th
Security with my men,</i>

1405
01:31:18,505 --> 01:31:20,922
we can stop them.

1406
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:30,088
Brigadier?

1407
01:31:31,839 --> 01:31:33,505
<i>Brigadier!</i>

1408
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,338
<i>Go on.</i>

1409
01:31:48,338 --> 01:31:51,046
I don't want to have this fight either.

1410
01:31:53,172 --> 01:31:56,130
But we can't let them have Seoul.

1411
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:02,630
Think about why you and
I still wear this uniform...

1412
01:32:08,172 --> 01:32:14,088
Are we not soldiers who
must fight when needed?

1413
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:18,213
I will hold my ground.

1414
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:19,797
Win or lose,

1415
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:21,921
<i>I'll fight anyway.</i>

1416
01:32:34,797 --> 01:32:36,756
<i>We'll mobilize.</i>

1417
01:32:37,505 --> 01:32:40,379
I'll be at the Army HQ in an hour.

1418
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:42,046
Thank you.

1419
01:32:51,797 --> 01:32:54,337
Goddammit!

1420
01:32:54,338 --> 01:32:56,756
8th Airborne is coming. Even
sooner than 2nd Airborne.

1421
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:57,838
What?

1422
01:32:57,839 --> 01:32:59,213
Shit!

1423
01:32:59,297 --> 01:33:01,004
Do you know any officers there?

1424
01:33:01,005 --> 01:33:03,005
We have no connection there.

1425
01:33:04,213 --> 01:33:05,879
I knew this would happen.

1426
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,130
Do you know anyone?

1427
01:33:07,213 --> 01:33:10,129
This had to be executed perfectly!

1428
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:12,880
We should've stuck
to the plan. We're dead!

1429
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:16,255
General Chun, say something!

1430
01:33:17,213 --> 01:33:19,547
Look at them.

1431
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:25,047
How did these cowering
bastards earn their stars?

1432
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:28,839
His Excellency must've
feared another coup,

1433
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:31,921
he only pinned stars on idiots.

1434
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:35,671
Chun! What did you just say?

1435
01:33:35,672 --> 01:33:36,796
Huh?

1436
01:33:36,797 --> 01:33:39,588
No, no.

1437
01:33:39,589 --> 01:33:41,713
Not the generals here.

1438
01:33:41,714 --> 01:33:45,296
I meant the shit stars at the Army HQ.

1439
01:33:45,297 --> 01:33:48,589
You crazy fool. What
took you so long to call me?

1440
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,672
I'm sorry, General.

1441
01:33:51,172 --> 01:33:53,046
I'll get an earful later.

1442
01:33:53,047 --> 01:33:54,755
<i>No, I mean…</i>

1443
01:33:54,756 --> 01:33:58,171
Why on earth did you stage this mutiny?

1444
01:33:58,172 --> 01:34:01,629
Chief Jeong is perfectly safe.

1445
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:05,379
I was going to ask him a few
questions and send him back.

1446
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,379
You guys are overreacting.

1447
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,129
<i>I really don't understand.</i>

1448
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:11,796
Is that supposed to be a joke?

1449
01:34:11,797 --> 01:34:16,296
Abducting the martial law commander
without the President's approval

1450
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:18,879
is a clear coup d'état!

1451
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,422
Gosh.

1452
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:24,714
I'll get you that damn
approval. That's no big deal.

1453
01:34:24,796 --> 01:34:28,004
And General, no one's staging a coup.

1454
01:34:28,005 --> 01:34:30,380
The Korean Army is
all on the same side.

1455
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:34,339
That's a very serious allegation
you're making right now.

1456
01:34:39,589 --> 01:34:41,005
Why did you call?

1457
01:34:41,213 --> 01:34:43,047
<i>You going to surrender?</i>

1458
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:44,463
General Min.

1459
01:34:44,464 --> 01:34:46,047
I'm listening.

1460
01:34:56,297 --> 01:34:57,838
<i>General Chun.</i>

1461
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:00,631
General Chun?

1462
01:35:08,005 --> 01:35:10,755
I'll tell the 2nd Airborne to return.

1463
01:35:12,631 --> 01:35:14,047
<i>In return,</i>

1464
01:35:15,339 --> 01:35:17,962
order your men to do the same.

1465
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:22,297
- Both sides take a step back?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1466
01:35:22,672 --> 01:35:24,754
I'm proposing a gentlemen's agreement.

1467
01:35:24,755 --> 01:35:25,880
No.

1468
01:35:26,422 --> 01:35:27,588
Sir,

1469
01:35:27,589 --> 01:35:29,880
<i>you can't accept that.</i>

1470
01:35:31,255 --> 01:35:33,963
They won't back off so easily.

1471
01:35:34,047 --> 01:35:36,379
General, don't trust them.

1472
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,796
<i>General, please!</i>

1473
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,296
<i>General Chun, withdraw
2nd Airborne first.</i>

1474
01:35:42,297 --> 01:35:44,339
<i>Then I'll have 8th Airborne return.</i>

1475
01:35:47,047 --> 01:35:49,589
Yes, sir. Stop the car.

1476
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:56,005
What? They're going back again.

1477
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,255
We're almost there.

1478
01:35:59,005 --> 01:36:00,379
Can't we just stand by here?

1479
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,921
<i>No, we confirmed their withdrawal.</i>

1480
01:36:02,922 --> 01:36:05,547
You're putting our agreement at risk.

1481
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:08,087
There are rebels left
at the 30th Security,

1482
01:36:08,088 --> 01:36:09,379
so we must stop them.

1483
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:12,254
We made an agreement,
so there are no rebels!

1484
01:36:12,255 --> 01:36:15,339
I'm ordering you to
return to your base.

1485
01:36:17,589 --> 01:36:19,796
You're withdrawing the 8th Airborne?

1486
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,339
What nonsense is that?

1487
01:36:22,963 --> 01:36:26,297
I've put you through, so
you can speak up now.

1488
01:36:28,506 --> 01:36:31,922
<i>This is Special Warfare
Commander Gong Soo-hyuk.</i>

1489
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:35,795
<i>Everyone, please listen to me.</i>

1490
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:37,838
A gentlemen's agreement?

1491
01:36:37,922 --> 01:36:41,630
<i>What kind of bullshit is that?</i>

1492
01:36:41,631 --> 01:36:43,712
<i>Do Hee-chul at 2nd Airborne</i>

1493
01:36:43,713 --> 01:36:47,505
disobeyed his superior
and raced like a mad dog

1494
01:36:47,506 --> 01:36:50,631
<i>to take down all of you standing there.</i>

1495
01:36:50,713 --> 01:36:55,631
<i>You can't make a pact
with a son of a bitch like...</i>

1496
01:37:13,297 --> 01:37:15,088
We're ready to cross, sir.

1497
01:37:15,214 --> 01:37:16,464
Let's go.

1498
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:25,421
Brigadier, don't leave.
You've got to come back.

1499
01:37:25,422 --> 01:37:27,379
The order is from the Army HQ.

1500
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:29,588
Even my Commander
is under their orders.

1501
01:37:29,589 --> 01:37:30,879
How can I refuse?

1502
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,214
Then stop for a second,
and stand by where you are.

1503
01:37:35,297 --> 01:37:36,754
I really want to,

1504
01:37:36,755 --> 01:37:38,837
but the Vice Chief
of Staff told us not to.

1505
01:37:38,838 --> 01:37:40,422
Trust me.

1506
01:37:40,755 --> 01:37:42,713
The rebels are lying.

1507
01:37:42,797 --> 01:37:45,214
You must know that too.

1508
01:37:45,297 --> 01:37:46,880
I'm sorry, Commander.

1509
01:37:48,713 --> 01:37:49,962
Sorry.

1510
01:37:49,963 --> 01:37:52,005
8th Airborne is gone.

1511
01:38:00,963 --> 01:38:03,547
Hey, put it down.

1512
01:38:04,047 --> 01:38:05,797
You won't shoot me.

1513
01:38:11,713 --> 01:38:13,214
Allegiance!

1514
01:38:20,588 --> 01:38:22,255
Are they looking for me?

1515
01:38:23,713 --> 01:38:25,047
Gentlemen.

1516
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:26,797
Good work.

1517
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,088
You are all here.

1518
01:38:28,089 --> 01:38:31,005
Minister! Where have you been?

1519
01:38:31,089 --> 01:38:33,088
I was at the Combined Forces Command.

1520
01:38:33,089 --> 01:38:35,088
I heard about the incident,

1521
01:38:35,089 --> 01:38:38,838
so I talked to the US
ambassador and CFC commander,

1522
01:38:38,922 --> 01:38:41,587
and made some
analysis of the situation.

1523
01:38:41,588 --> 01:38:42,962
Minister!

1524
01:38:42,963 --> 01:38:44,463
I'm glad you're here.

1525
01:38:44,464 --> 01:38:46,962
Please order Chun's arrest right now.

1526
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,546
Stay out of this.

1527
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,047
Where do I sit?

1528
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,089
This way, Minister.

1529
01:38:52,464 --> 01:38:55,921
I talked Chun out of
involving our Airbornes.

1530
01:38:55,922 --> 01:38:57,754
So if you could explain to them...

1531
01:38:57,755 --> 01:39:02,296
Seriously, you should've
talked to them in the first place!

1532
01:39:02,297 --> 01:39:05,422
How thoughtless of you
to declare DEFCON 1.

1533
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:07,171
Sir, what do you mean?

1534
01:39:07,172 --> 01:39:11,004
The Army Chief of Staff is
abducted. This is a coup d'état.

1535
01:39:11,005 --> 01:39:14,796
Who are you? Oh, the Provost Marshal.

1536
01:39:14,797 --> 01:39:19,838
His gang are scum who
tried to take over the country!

1537
01:39:20,546 --> 01:39:21,713
Hey!

1538
01:39:22,422 --> 01:39:24,005
Stop stuttering!

1539
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:26,047
Did you see it?

1540
01:39:26,922 --> 01:39:27,755
What is it?

1541
01:39:27,756 --> 01:39:30,297
2nd Airborne crossed the
bridge and are coming this way.

1542
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:31,712
What?

1543
01:39:31,713 --> 01:39:33,922
Defending the capital
is everyone's mission!

1544
01:39:34,005 --> 01:39:35,380
Don't hang up!

1545
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:36,922
You've got to listen to me.

1546
01:39:37,005 --> 01:39:38,005
This is a coup d'état!

1547
01:39:38,047 --> 01:39:39,796
We must defend Seoul!

1548
01:39:39,797 --> 01:39:41,088
I told you already!

1549
01:39:41,089 --> 01:39:42,797
Hurry up!

1550
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,339
General.

1551
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,171
- He's looking for you inside.
- Who is?

1552
01:39:47,172 --> 01:39:49,130
The Minister, sir.

1553
01:39:49,297 --> 01:39:52,712
Can't we ask the US
Army for combat troops?

1554
01:39:52,713 --> 01:39:54,172
We have less than 30 minutes...

1555
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:56,754
What's the use of staying here?

1556
01:39:56,755 --> 01:39:59,837
We need to go where
we can be protected.

1557
01:39:59,838 --> 01:40:01,421
- How about the CGC?
- What?

1558
01:40:01,422 --> 01:40:03,796
- At least General Lee is there.
- Right.

1559
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:05,504
Did you ask for me?

1560
01:40:05,505 --> 01:40:10,089
Do you know my car?
Is my Ford still out there?

1561
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:13,838
Minister, then who
will defend this place?

1562
01:40:14,672 --> 01:40:18,047
That's not the minister's job, is it?

1563
01:40:19,422 --> 01:40:20,922
Commander!

1564
01:40:22,672 --> 01:40:25,713
The Army HQ command
is coming over to us.

1565
01:40:26,463 --> 01:40:29,588
They all want to hide behind your back.

1566
01:40:29,672 --> 01:40:32,089
If Chun really wins
control of the army,

1567
01:40:32,172 --> 01:40:34,296
won't they make you into a scapegoat?

1568
01:40:34,297 --> 01:40:35,880
Kang Dong-chan!

1569
01:40:36,922 --> 01:40:38,964
Watch your mouth.

1570
01:40:41,297 --> 01:40:44,421
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

1571
01:40:50,755 --> 01:40:52,213
Commander!

1572
01:40:52,214 --> 01:40:55,255
Sir, are you really
giving up this place?

1573
01:40:55,256 --> 01:40:56,898
I heard CGC is running
short on soldiers, too.

1574
01:40:56,922 --> 01:40:58,921
But we have nowhere to go.

1575
01:40:58,922 --> 01:41:01,130
We can't just hand it over to them!

1576
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,380
Once we move the command,
I'll sort things out with Chun.

1577
01:41:07,381 --> 01:41:09,420
It'll just take 5 minutes to talk.

1578
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:13,630
- Chun always listens to me...
- How can you say that as minister?

1579
01:41:13,713 --> 01:41:16,047
Who do you think you are?

1580
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:20,046
How dare a one-star
talk back to the minister?

1581
01:41:20,047 --> 01:41:21,921
You arrogant little shit.

1582
01:41:21,922 --> 01:41:25,629
I said I'll talk to Chun
and work things out!

1583
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:28,712
Who has a better idea? Anyone?

1584
01:41:28,713 --> 01:41:31,630
Why should we humor
someone who started a coup?

1585
01:41:31,964 --> 01:41:34,922
Come to your senses, please!

1586
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:36,462
- General.
- Joon-yup...

1587
01:41:36,463 --> 01:41:40,297
I'll do it! I'll stop them somehow.

1588
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,047
Please don't abandon your posts.

1589
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:44,255
If we let them take this country,

1590
01:41:44,256 --> 01:41:46,339
it'll be a great dishonor to this army.

1591
01:41:47,964 --> 01:41:52,421
Generals, I beg you with all my heart.

1592
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:55,922
CGC is right around the
corner, so hop in any car.

1593
01:41:56,005 --> 01:41:57,297
Where's my car?

1594
01:41:59,463 --> 01:42:02,005
This is ours. Yours is up front!

1595
01:42:02,089 --> 01:42:03,463
Oh, okay.

1596
01:42:03,547 --> 01:42:05,922
- Those skanks!
- Take the one behind!

1597
01:42:06,005 --> 01:42:07,672
The Minister.

1598
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:11,255
Where'd he go now?

1599
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:15,713
- Where did our Minister go?
- He left already.

1600
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:19,839
They abandoned the HQ and fled to CGC.

1601
01:42:21,214 --> 01:42:23,712
Those idiots.

1602
01:42:23,713 --> 01:42:25,463
That bunker is impenetrable.

1603
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,963
Saved us from trouble.

1604
01:42:27,964 --> 01:42:32,171
It's not over yet. We haven't
captured Lee and Gong.

1605
01:42:32,172 --> 01:42:34,588
Jang, any news from Kim Chang-se?

1606
01:42:34,672 --> 01:42:37,755
He's ready to take the
Special Warfare Command.

1607
01:42:46,588 --> 01:42:48,964
Major Oh at the commander's
office is your friend?

1608
01:42:50,214 --> 01:42:51,921
He's a year below me, sir.

1609
01:42:51,922 --> 01:42:55,214
We're also neighbors. Our
wives know each other well.

1610
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:59,672
It's nothing personal,

1611
01:43:01,047 --> 01:43:03,964
so just follow orders as a soldier.

1612
01:43:05,922 --> 01:43:08,421
Are you staying? We gotta get out.

1613
01:43:08,797 --> 01:43:11,964
But our Commander
didn't give the order yet...

1614
01:43:14,713 --> 01:43:19,296
If you wish to leave,
you are free to go.

1615
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:22,588
Commander, you must evacuate now.

1616
01:43:22,672 --> 01:43:24,338
Don't worry about me.

1617
01:43:24,713 --> 01:43:26,797
Everyone, go.

1618
01:43:27,172 --> 01:43:28,630
That's an order.

1619
01:43:29,047 --> 01:43:30,089
Leave!

1620
01:43:30,214 --> 01:43:31,421
Sorry, sir.

1621
01:43:31,422 --> 01:43:32,546
Commander.

1622
01:43:32,547 --> 01:43:35,005
- Sir, you should first...
- Major Oh.

1623
01:43:35,089 --> 01:43:38,214
I want you to leave with others.

1624
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:41,255
Go.

1625
01:43:43,131 --> 01:43:43,922
Attack!

1626
01:43:44,047 --> 01:43:45,214
Attack!

1627
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,672
What are you doing?

1628
01:43:58,755 --> 01:44:00,713
I ordered you to evacuate.

1629
01:44:01,755 --> 01:44:05,505
If you're here, I should be too, sir.

1630
01:44:09,172 --> 01:44:13,004
Hey, I can protect myself!

1631
01:44:13,005 --> 01:44:14,672
I know, sir.

1632
01:44:15,338 --> 01:44:19,505
But you'll be lonely here.

1633
01:44:34,672 --> 01:44:36,380
Jin-ho.

1634
01:44:37,255 --> 01:44:39,839
Aren't you scared?

1635
01:44:41,296 --> 01:44:42,547
To be honest,

1636
01:44:43,089 --> 01:44:44,672
I am, sir.

1637
01:44:45,964 --> 01:44:50,131
But it's okay because
I'm with you, sir.

1638
01:44:52,422 --> 01:44:54,089
Oh Jin-ho.

1639
01:44:54,588 --> 01:44:56,630
I thought you were smart,

1640
01:44:56,714 --> 01:44:59,047
but I guess you're a bit slow.

1641
01:45:13,505 --> 01:45:15,213
Hey, stop.

1642
01:45:15,296 --> 01:45:16,964
Step back.

1643
01:45:17,338 --> 01:45:19,171
We've seized the whole building!

1644
01:45:19,255 --> 01:45:21,714
Do not resist and step out!

1645
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:24,797
Open the door on the count of five,

1646
01:45:25,922 --> 01:45:27,212
or we'll shoot.

1647
01:45:27,213 --> 01:45:29,171
Sir, let's just fire.

1648
01:45:33,006 --> 01:45:36,297
Major Oh, it's me.

1649
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:39,047
Hey, Jin-ho.

1650
01:45:39,422 --> 01:45:41,089
Answer me.

1651
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:43,505
I'm warning you.

1652
01:45:45,338 --> 01:45:47,047
Whoever you are,

1653
01:45:47,839 --> 01:45:50,504
step one foot in this office,

1654
01:45:50,505 --> 01:45:52,213
and I'll fire!

1655
01:45:54,255 --> 01:45:55,463
Jin-ho.

1656
01:45:57,422 --> 01:45:58,587
Take cover.

1657
01:45:58,588 --> 01:46:00,130
<i>This is the Brigadier.</i>

1658
01:46:00,213 --> 01:46:02,588
<i>What's taking so long? Take them out!</i>

1659
01:46:02,672 --> 01:46:05,755
<i>He's no longer your commander!</i>

1660
01:46:05,839 --> 01:46:07,714
<i>Finish them off!</i>

1661
01:46:19,672 --> 01:46:21,005
Jin-ho, are you okay?

1662
01:46:21,006 --> 01:46:22,047
I'm fine, sir!

1663
01:46:23,547 --> 01:46:24,714
Get back!

1664
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:27,547
Sergeant!

1665
01:46:53,672 --> 01:46:54,963
Sir!

1666
01:46:54,964 --> 01:46:55,797
Are you alright?

1667
01:46:55,798 --> 01:46:56,839
Bastards!

1668
01:47:03,964 --> 01:47:04,714
Stop!

1669
01:47:04,715 --> 01:47:06,006
Cease fire!

1670
01:47:14,839 --> 01:47:16,212
Jin-ho.

1671
01:47:16,213 --> 01:47:17,547
Hey.

1672
01:47:31,255 --> 01:47:32,922
Son of a bitch...

1673
01:47:37,422 --> 01:47:39,380
Commander, you're under arrest.

1674
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:41,255
Call the medic.

1675
01:47:41,338 --> 01:47:43,172
We gotta save Jin-ho.

1676
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:47,297
Take your hands off him!

1677
01:47:47,463 --> 01:47:49,046
He's your friend.

1678
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:52,213
Your closest friend!

1679
01:47:54,797 --> 01:47:56,338
Get the medic.

1680
01:47:57,422 --> 01:47:58,921
Kim Chang-se.

1681
01:47:58,922 --> 01:48:03,797
I led you for 15 years...
thought of you as my son.

1682
01:48:04,463 --> 01:48:07,589
How do you like being Chun's dog?

1683
01:48:07,672 --> 01:48:10,255
It's nothing personal, Commander.

1684
01:48:11,714 --> 01:48:15,338
If the medic's not coming,
take him yourselves!

1685
01:48:15,422 --> 01:48:17,796
- Take him now.
- Yes, sir.

1686
01:48:17,797 --> 01:48:19,130
Jin-ho.

1687
01:48:20,255 --> 01:48:21,881
Let me go.

1688
01:48:21,963 --> 01:48:23,880
Let go, you bastards!

1689
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:25,422
No!

1690
01:48:25,505 --> 01:48:28,255
Jin-ho... Jin-ho!

1691
01:48:30,547 --> 01:48:32,338
Jin-ho!

1692
01:48:32,422 --> 01:48:33,963
Jin-ho!

1693
01:48:41,547 --> 01:48:43,045
<i>Commander, it's Lee.</i>

1694
01:48:43,046 --> 01:48:45,754
He's just been arrested.

1695
01:48:45,755 --> 01:48:46,547
Who are you?

1696
01:48:46,548 --> 01:48:48,422
<i>The tables have completely turned.</i>

1697
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:50,839
Please make a wise decision

1698
01:48:51,839 --> 01:48:55,714
to avoid unnecessary sacrifice.

1699
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:05,797
They are here.

1700
01:49:05,798 --> 01:49:07,464
Commander.

1701
01:49:09,422 --> 01:49:10,881
Must be tough.

1702
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:13,297
Man, it's cold.

1703
01:49:18,797 --> 01:49:21,630
<i>Take out the soldiers
on the first floor!</i>

1704
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:33,297
<i>The gate is open, lead
car entering now.</i>

1705
01:49:34,547 --> 01:49:35,714
Great work!

1706
01:49:49,255 --> 01:49:50,421
What?

1707
01:49:50,422 --> 01:49:51,172
Hands in the air!

1708
01:49:51,173 --> 01:49:53,129
- It's me.
- Shut up and come out!

1709
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:54,005
I'm the Minister.

1710
01:49:54,006 --> 01:49:56,713
- I hear you. Come out!
- I said I'm the Minister!

1711
01:49:56,714 --> 01:49:58,589
I'm Noh Guk-sang,
the Minister of Defense!

1712
01:50:00,172 --> 01:50:01,380
Push your way in!

1713
01:50:05,047 --> 01:50:06,172
Hurry!

1714
01:50:07,255 --> 01:50:09,213
Don't move! Drop your guns!

1715
01:50:09,297 --> 01:50:10,505
Now!

1716
01:50:14,505 --> 01:50:16,004
You can't enter here.

1717
01:50:16,005 --> 01:50:17,171
Move!

1718
01:50:17,172 --> 01:50:18,047
- Let go!
- No.

1719
01:50:18,048 --> 01:50:19,837
- You bastard!
- I said no!

1720
01:50:19,838 --> 01:50:22,380
- You fuck...
- I said no! No!

1721
01:50:30,921 --> 01:50:34,255
<i>General, what's the status there?</i>

1722
01:50:34,339 --> 01:50:37,920
Commander, I'm so sorry.

1723
01:50:37,921 --> 01:50:38,672
You, get up!

1724
01:50:38,673 --> 01:50:41,005
Looks like I'm done.

1725
01:50:41,088 --> 01:50:42,547
What's going on?

1726
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:47,505
General Kim, are you okay?

1727
01:50:47,589 --> 01:50:49,797
You're our last hope.

1728
01:51:06,589 --> 01:51:07,713
Colonel Kang.

1729
01:51:07,714 --> 01:51:08,631
Yes, sir.

1730
01:51:08,632 --> 01:51:11,838
Assemble all available
soldiers in the drill ground now.

1731
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,422
General!

1732
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:16,714
What are you going to do?

1733
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:20,547
I'm going to take down Chun.

1734
01:51:22,005 --> 01:51:23,297
Damn.

1735
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:39,962
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Did I wake you?

1736
01:51:39,963 --> 01:51:41,422
<i>Not at all.</i>

1737
01:51:41,505 --> 01:51:44,505
I thought you'd come
home, will it be later?

1738
01:51:45,255 --> 01:51:47,338
I hate to say this.

1739
01:51:47,339 --> 01:51:49,504
But I don't think I can come today.

1740
01:51:49,505 --> 01:51:53,464
I was going to make your
favorite stew for breakfast.

1741
01:51:53,922 --> 01:51:55,755
Can't you come in the morning?

1742
01:51:56,589 --> 01:51:58,255
I'm really sorry.

1743
01:51:58,505 --> 01:52:01,130
<i>What's with you saying sorry today?</i>

1744
01:52:01,505 --> 01:52:05,547
Don't skip meals even if you're busy.

1745
01:52:07,297 --> 01:52:09,339
I'll just quit if they starve me.

1746
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:12,755
<i>Stop joking about that. It's not funny.</i>

1747
01:52:17,755 --> 01:52:19,380
Honey,

1748
01:52:19,672 --> 01:52:21,838
is something wrong?

1749
01:52:25,922 --> 01:52:27,213
No.

1750
01:52:27,214 --> 01:52:28,713
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1751
01:52:29,339 --> 01:52:30,214
Huh?

1752
01:52:30,215 --> 01:52:32,796
I almost forgot to tell you.

1753
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,547
There's a scarf inside your bag.

1754
01:52:35,631 --> 01:52:38,631
<i>I bought it for you at the market.</i>

1755
01:52:39,422 --> 01:52:41,047
It's cold outside.

1756
01:52:41,339 --> 01:52:43,713
Wear it when you go out.

1757
01:52:48,963 --> 01:52:51,589
- Goodbye, then.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1758
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,630
- Ready in 5 minutes.
- How many do we have?

1759
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:02,338
Four tanks, four APCs,

1760
01:53:02,339 --> 01:53:05,213
and about 100 soldiers including
heavy weapon squads, sir.

1761
01:53:05,214 --> 01:53:08,838
I told you to include
all non-combat soldiers.

1762
01:53:09,631 --> 01:53:10,880
They're all included.

1763
01:53:12,589 --> 01:53:14,087
Commander.

1764
01:53:14,088 --> 01:53:16,712
- Permission to speak freely, sir?
- Keep it short.

1765
01:53:16,713 --> 01:53:20,005
I think you've done enough.

1766
01:53:21,130 --> 01:53:22,631
Enough?

1767
01:53:23,005 --> 01:53:24,755
It's over already.

1768
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:27,713
We lost the Ministry of
Defense and the bunker.

1769
01:53:27,796 --> 01:53:29,589
Those generals in the situation room

1770
01:53:29,671 --> 01:53:32,129
also say it's useless to fight.

1771
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:35,339
Even when the rebels
are taking over the country?

1772
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:37,338
Did you get a call from them, too?

1773
01:53:37,339 --> 01:53:39,214
Didn't you know?

1774
01:53:39,589 --> 01:53:43,796
Not just me, everyone here got a call!

1775
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:48,214
Of course, I swore at them and hung up.

1776
01:53:49,922 --> 01:53:51,214
Good job.

1777
01:53:51,755 --> 01:53:53,297
Commander.

1778
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:56,005
Everyone gave in except for you.

1779
01:53:56,088 --> 01:53:58,254
Even if we continue to fight,

1780
01:53:58,255 --> 01:54:01,087
there's no chance we'll win.

1781
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,172
So?

1782
01:54:03,172 --> 01:54:04,838
When spring comes,

1783
01:54:04,922 --> 01:54:08,422
shouldn't you see
your son start college?

1784
01:54:09,963 --> 01:54:12,297
How dare you!

1785
01:54:12,963 --> 01:54:17,088
Do you really want to see your
commander surrender to Chun?

1786
01:54:17,797 --> 01:54:22,671
My country's falling to
traitors right before my eyes...

1787
01:54:22,963 --> 01:54:25,922
And no soldier will fight to the end.

1788
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,838
What kind of army is that?

1789
01:54:37,922 --> 01:54:39,880
I don't care what others do.

1790
01:54:41,297 --> 01:54:45,588
Everyone lives by their own principles.

1791
01:54:46,047 --> 01:54:47,506
But look here.

1792
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:50,089
What does it say in front of my name?

1793
01:54:50,963 --> 01:54:54,838
The Capital Garrison
Commander is not leaving the city.

1794
01:54:56,005 --> 01:54:59,297
Our unit will protect Seoul tonight.

1795
01:55:00,922 --> 01:55:03,297
Withdraw your command!

1796
01:55:10,172 --> 01:55:11,963
Are you ordering me?

1797
01:55:16,047 --> 01:55:18,545
I can't have my soldiers die

1798
01:55:18,546 --> 01:55:21,129
due to my superior's misjudgement.

1799
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:22,630
Are you going to shoot?

1800
01:55:23,047 --> 01:55:24,464
Yes.

1801
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,880
Shoot, if you've made up your mind.

1802
01:55:33,506 --> 01:55:35,963
You're a good commander.

1803
01:55:36,047 --> 01:55:39,588
If you think it's the right call
for your men, pull the trigger.

1804
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,421
Stop!

1805
01:55:44,422 --> 01:55:47,422
Take one more step, and I'll shoot.

1806
01:55:48,755 --> 01:55:51,713
Do it quickly. I don't have time.

1807
01:55:52,546 --> 01:55:54,672
If not, come to the drill ground.

1808
01:56:05,797 --> 01:56:07,755
The rebels who abducted

1809
01:56:07,838 --> 01:56:09,963
the Army Chief of Staff

1810
01:56:10,047 --> 01:56:12,713
are now at the 30th Security.

1811
01:56:12,838 --> 01:56:16,963
They incited a rebellion
to seize state power.

1812
01:56:17,047 --> 01:56:19,381
Letting part of the CGC agree to it

1813
01:56:19,464 --> 01:56:22,755
makes me ashamed as commander.

1814
01:56:25,297 --> 01:56:27,921
But I can't tolerate this action

1815
01:56:27,922 --> 01:56:31,838
as a soldier of the Republic of Korea.

1816
01:56:37,546 --> 01:56:40,381
Tonight's going to be rough.

1817
01:56:42,713 --> 01:56:47,005
If you wish to leave, you may go now.

1818
01:56:56,838 --> 01:57:02,588
You're soldiers of the Shield
Corps, bearing CGC's honor and duty.

1819
01:57:03,005 --> 01:57:04,713
And as its commander,

1820
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:09,213
I will subdue the rebels
with my brave soldiers.

1821
01:57:09,214 --> 01:57:10,297
Live to defend!

1822
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:11,880
Die to serve!

1823
01:57:11,964 --> 01:57:14,505
Present arms!

1824
01:57:14,588 --> 01:57:16,172
Allegiance!

1825
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:18,630
Allegiance.

1826
01:57:29,172 --> 01:57:30,964
<i>They passed City Hall</i>

1827
01:57:31,797 --> 01:57:33,505
and entered Sejongno.

1828
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:38,880
Lee can jump into this war
because he has a cause.

1829
01:57:39,047 --> 01:57:40,796
- Jang!
- Yes, sir.

1830
01:57:40,797 --> 01:57:45,338
You stop those bastards,
and be sure not to fire first.

1831
01:57:45,339 --> 01:57:46,755
Yes, sir.

1832
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,630
Move in combat formation.

1833
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:20,297
<i>All rebels in 30th Security, listen up.</i>

1834
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:23,629
<i>I am CGC Commander Lee Tae-shin.</i>

1835
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:27,421
<i>Disarm and surrender now.</i>

1836
01:58:30,089 --> 01:58:32,296
<i>You are soldiers of Korean Army</i>

1837
01:58:32,297 --> 01:58:35,255
<i>and under CGC's command.</i>

1838
01:58:35,256 --> 01:58:41,880
<i>I know better than anyone
you aren't here voluntarily.</i>

1839
01:58:41,964 --> 01:58:45,005
<i>It's not too late to
lay down your guns.</i>

1840
01:58:45,421 --> 01:58:46,755
When's the 9th Division arriving?

1841
01:58:46,839 --> 01:58:48,879
It'll take more than 20 minutes.

1842
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,754
They set off ages ago.

1843
01:58:50,755 --> 01:58:53,214
Tell them to come at full speed.

1844
01:58:53,297 --> 01:58:55,089
Hey, hurry up.

1845
01:58:55,421 --> 01:58:57,338
Push through them!

1846
01:59:00,172 --> 01:59:00,880
They're coming in.

1847
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:04,713
Do not engage until they fire first.

1848
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:09,130
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1849
01:59:09,505 --> 01:59:12,172
I'm the Security Commander,
Chun Doo-gwang.

1850
01:59:12,588 --> 01:59:15,089
What on earth are you doing?

1851
01:59:15,172 --> 01:59:19,588
Can't you see you don't
stand a chance here?

1852
01:59:20,713 --> 01:59:22,379
Did you really think

1853
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:25,256
<i>you could threaten
us with only four tanks?</i>

1854
01:59:25,338 --> 01:59:27,380
Colonel, this is your commander.

1855
01:59:27,463 --> 01:59:29,630
<i>Report if you're ready to fire.</i>

1856
01:59:29,964 --> 01:59:33,504
Target, 30th Security.
155mm high explosives,

1857
01:59:33,505 --> 01:59:36,213
<i>one battery, three
rounds, ready to fire, sir.</i>

1858
01:59:36,214 --> 01:59:37,546
<i>Fix the firing point</i>

1859
01:59:37,547 --> 01:59:41,004
to the 30th Security Group,
where the rebels are hiding.

1860
01:59:41,005 --> 01:59:43,088
<i>Deflection angle 2, 5, 0, 5.</i>

1861
01:59:43,089 --> 01:59:45,587
<i>Tilt angle 3, 6, 4!</i>

1862
01:59:45,588 --> 01:59:47,713
Fixed to the 30th Security!

1863
01:59:48,505 --> 01:59:50,838
Hey, is this for real?

1864
01:59:50,839 --> 01:59:53,256
Buy some time, I'll call the Artillery.

1865
01:59:54,296 --> 01:59:55,546
Unit at my command!

1866
01:59:55,547 --> 01:59:58,504
Tilt angle 3, 6, 4!

1867
01:59:58,505 --> 02:00:00,587
- Shell ready!
- Ready to fire!

1868
02:00:00,588 --> 02:00:02,672
Come on, Commander.

1869
02:00:03,713 --> 02:00:08,047
<i>Are you really going
to burn down Seoul?</i>

1870
02:00:08,797 --> 02:00:12,547
Stop this and come in for a minute.

1871
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:14,422
<i>I can explain all this.</i>

1872
02:00:14,505 --> 02:00:16,879
You're not worth listening to.

1873
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,546
<i>Colonel Yoo!</i>

1874
02:00:18,547 --> 02:00:20,838
<i>On my command, strike with precision.</i>

1875
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:23,505
- "Precision"?
- That nutcase!

1876
02:00:24,255 --> 02:00:26,130
Hand me my gun.

1877
02:00:26,131 --> 02:00:28,588
General, how did this happen?

1878
02:00:31,463 --> 02:00:35,088
Just calm down, for fuck's sake!

1879
02:00:35,089 --> 02:00:37,295
I need to think, so just shut up!

1880
02:00:37,296 --> 02:00:41,380
<i>Some CGC commanders
will be severely punished.</i>

1881
02:00:41,463 --> 02:00:45,463
I'll go out and stop
him whatever it takes.

1882
02:00:45,547 --> 02:00:49,004
You take care of this place, okay?

1883
02:00:49,005 --> 02:00:50,379
Alright.

1884
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,547
- Say something.
- Hey!

1885
02:00:51,714 --> 02:00:55,004
<i>Colonel, the target
point has to be precise.</i>

1886
02:00:55,005 --> 02:00:57,295
You do understand
what that means, right?

1887
02:00:57,296 --> 02:00:58,755
<i>Commander.</i>

1888
02:00:59,047 --> 02:01:02,213
Could you reconsider your order?

1889
02:01:04,131 --> 02:01:08,380
Target remains the 30th Security.

1890
02:01:10,839 --> 02:01:12,047
Yes, sir.

1891
02:01:17,131 --> 02:01:19,714
<i>- I ask all of you officers.</i>
- That prick.

1892
02:01:20,131 --> 02:01:24,255
<i>Why do our men need to be sacrificed?</i>

1893
02:01:24,839 --> 02:01:27,006
<i>You take orders from me,</i>

1894
02:01:27,089 --> 02:01:28,839
<i>the Capital Garrison Commander.</i>

1895
02:01:29,755 --> 02:01:33,922
<i>Surrender now, and I won't
bring charges against you.</i>

1896
02:01:34,755 --> 02:01:35,755
Here, sir.

1897
02:01:38,296 --> 02:01:42,421
All of you with Commander
Lee, listen carefully.

1898
02:01:42,422 --> 02:01:46,047
If you do anything dangerous,

1899
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:51,422
I will engage in full-scale
war, and wipe all of you out!

1900
02:01:52,588 --> 02:01:56,797
In exactly 5 minutes,
the artillery will start firing.

1901
02:02:00,964 --> 02:02:03,046
If you fire on us,

1902
02:02:03,047 --> 02:02:05,880
where do you think
the shells will fall?

1903
02:02:06,422 --> 02:02:12,505
They'll fall on your
heads! Then, we'll all die!

1904
02:02:27,839 --> 02:02:29,463
Did you talk to the Artillery?

1905
02:02:29,547 --> 02:02:31,755
No, I can't reach him.

1906
02:02:31,797 --> 02:02:33,380
<i>What should we do?</i>

1907
02:02:33,714 --> 02:02:38,380
You have two minutes until we fire.

1908
02:02:38,672 --> 02:02:39,754
Sure!

1909
02:02:39,755 --> 02:02:41,879
Just fire it already!

1910
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:46,630
That'll give the commies a
great chance to invade us!

1911
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:50,671
All responsibility falls on you,

1912
02:02:50,672 --> 02:02:53,338
so brace yourself
before you start this!

1913
02:02:53,755 --> 02:02:56,047
I did that long ago.

1914
02:03:00,255 --> 02:03:03,087
When the firing begins, we'll attack!

1915
02:03:03,088 --> 02:03:05,589
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

1916
02:03:05,797 --> 02:03:08,338
All gunners, stand fast!

1917
02:03:08,422 --> 02:03:11,171
That son of a bitch...

1918
02:03:12,213 --> 02:03:13,880
Where do you think you're going?

1919
02:03:13,964 --> 02:03:18,547
Hey, I'm about to burst
now. Should I pee here?

1920
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:44,337
<i>General Lee? This is
the Minister of Defense.</i>

1921
02:03:44,338 --> 02:03:46,380
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

1922
02:03:46,797 --> 02:03:48,671
It's all over now.

1923
02:03:48,672 --> 02:03:50,964
<i>General Lee Tae-shin.</i>

1924
02:03:51,797 --> 02:03:53,380
Hold your fire!

1925
02:03:53,463 --> 02:03:56,421
Minister, why are you
using their channel?

1926
02:03:56,422 --> 02:03:59,964
Man, you have to talk this through.

1927
02:04:00,046 --> 02:04:03,088
<i>Why do you want to shed blood?</i>

1928
02:04:04,046 --> 02:04:05,630
Press him harder.

1929
02:04:07,255 --> 02:04:11,714
I just finished my conversation
with General Chun.

1930
02:04:11,797 --> 02:04:15,504
So, go back to Garrison
Command and stand by.

1931
02:04:15,505 --> 02:04:16,964
No.

1932
02:04:17,797 --> 02:04:19,296
I can't do that.

1933
02:04:19,297 --> 02:04:21,546
It's an order from the
Minister of Defense.

1934
02:04:21,547 --> 02:04:24,213
Say no more and turn back.

1935
02:04:26,505 --> 02:04:28,171
<i>Minister!</i>

1936
02:04:28,172 --> 02:04:30,422
Withdraw your order,

1937
02:04:30,505 --> 02:04:34,005
and order the entire army
to arrest Chun Doo-gwang.

1938
02:04:38,547 --> 02:04:39,963
Lee Tae-shin!

1939
02:04:39,964 --> 02:04:41,797
<i>Are you giving me orders?</i>

1940
02:04:41,881 --> 02:04:45,130
<i>You think I'm your subordinate?</i>

1941
02:04:47,839 --> 02:04:48,921
You listen.

1942
02:04:48,922 --> 02:04:53,589
<i>As of this minute, you are
removed from command.</i>

1943
02:04:53,672 --> 02:04:55,254
<i>You know what that means?</i>

1944
02:04:55,255 --> 02:04:58,005
You are nothing now!

1945
02:04:59,297 --> 02:05:03,505
Lee Tae-shin is not a
commander anymore!

1946
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:05,755
He's been removed!

1947
02:05:06,005 --> 02:05:11,714
CGC troops, you heard
what the Minister said!

1948
02:05:11,797 --> 02:05:14,963
Lee, traitor to the Army,

1949
02:05:15,046 --> 02:05:19,422
now has no authority over CGC.

1950
02:05:19,505 --> 02:05:24,422
Effective immediately, Lee Tae-shin
is no longer CGC Commander!

1951
02:05:33,922 --> 02:05:35,422
2nd Airborne is here.

1952
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:43,589
Halt!

1953
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:48,505
- All gunners, stand fast!
- Stand fast!

1954
02:05:51,422 --> 02:05:53,172
Hold your positions.

1955
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:55,255
Maintain formation.

1956
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:58,172
Hey! Move those people!

1957
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:00,297
Don't let civilians through.

1958
02:06:01,297 --> 02:06:03,130
- Jang.
- Yes, sir.

1959
02:06:03,338 --> 02:06:05,546
Let people come through.

1960
02:06:05,547 --> 02:06:08,421
- It's still dangerous here...
- Just do it.

1961
02:06:08,422 --> 02:06:09,338
Yes, sir.

1962
02:06:09,339 --> 02:06:10,505
Leave them!

1963
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:14,297
Sir, there are civilians there.

1964
02:06:15,255 --> 02:06:16,963
Don't block the civilians!

1965
02:06:22,088 --> 02:06:23,505
How was it?

1966
02:06:23,839 --> 02:06:26,379
The Minister's timing was perfect.

1967
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:28,880
Sir, it's the Chief of Artillery.

1968
02:06:28,963 --> 02:06:31,589
Commander, this is Colonel Yoo.

1969
02:06:32,172 --> 02:06:33,171
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

1970
02:06:33,172 --> 02:06:37,255
I can't follow your orders anymore.

1971
02:06:38,422 --> 02:06:41,130
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

1972
02:06:41,213 --> 02:06:44,714
I... truly am.

1973
02:07:01,088 --> 02:07:03,129
Soldiers.

1974
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:06,672
This is it. Thank you for your effort.

1975
02:07:16,672 --> 02:07:18,296
All of you,

1976
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:23,463
I thank you for serving the
most useless commander of all.

1977
02:07:23,464 --> 02:07:24,797
Commander.

1978
02:07:28,464 --> 02:07:32,505
Return to base and let them rest.

1979
02:07:32,672 --> 02:07:34,921
<i>You did very well.</i>

1980
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:38,921
General Lee made a brave decision!

1981
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:42,212
CGC troops, listen carefully.

1982
02:07:42,213 --> 02:07:45,838
Lay down your arms,
and turn the engines off.

1983
02:07:45,921 --> 02:07:50,212
Sorry I couldn't serve you better.

1984
02:07:50,213 --> 02:07:51,463
Sorry, sir.

1985
02:07:51,464 --> 02:07:59,456
<i>And if anyone is crazy enough
to defy me, I'll show no mercy!</i>

1986
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:07,796
Let me make one last
request as a commander.

1987
02:08:08,838 --> 02:08:10,880
Do not follow me.

1988
02:08:13,921 --> 02:08:15,547
Commander.

1989
02:08:20,088 --> 02:08:22,464
Look there, sir.

1990
02:08:38,297 --> 02:08:39,714
He's gone mad.

1991
02:08:51,547 --> 02:08:53,631
Chun Doo-gwang, you son of a bitch.

1992
02:08:54,005 --> 02:08:55,880
I won't let you go like this.

1993
02:08:58,172 --> 02:09:01,631
Can't we shoot him for
disobeying the Minister's order?

1994
02:09:02,005 --> 02:09:04,255
Give us permission to fire.

1995
02:09:06,297 --> 02:09:08,672
<i>I'm ordering all CGC troops!</i>

1996
02:09:08,755 --> 02:09:11,339
<i>Lee Tae-shin is a war criminal.</i>

1997
02:09:12,005 --> 02:09:13,837
<i>Shoot him!</i>

1998
02:09:13,838 --> 02:09:15,296
All troops, take aim.

1999
02:09:15,297 --> 02:09:17,297
Didn't you hear? Aim!

2000
02:09:20,838 --> 02:09:22,130
Target on mark.

2001
02:09:25,963 --> 02:09:27,505
We can't do this.

2002
02:09:27,589 --> 02:09:29,421
Too many eyes are on us.

2003
02:09:29,422 --> 02:09:31,464
Hands in the air, bastards!

2004
02:10:10,506 --> 02:10:15,255
You aren't worthy as a Korean soldier

2005
02:10:16,255 --> 02:10:20,880
or even a human being.

2006
02:10:30,963 --> 02:10:33,130
Sir, please come with me.

2007
02:10:41,297 --> 02:10:44,630
- Great job today.
- It's all over.

2008
02:10:45,047 --> 02:10:46,755
Don't laugh.

2009
02:10:54,838 --> 02:10:57,214
- Stop here for a second.
- Yes, sir.

2010
02:11:00,088 --> 02:11:01,087
What's wrong?

2011
02:11:01,088 --> 02:11:04,962
Go ahead first. You
tell them that we won.

2012
02:11:04,963 --> 02:11:06,630
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

2013
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:17,713
- We are...
- One!

2014
02:11:19,339 --> 02:11:20,422
Sorry about earlier, sir.

2015
02:11:20,506 --> 02:11:22,255
Oh, it was nothing.

2016
02:11:22,339 --> 02:11:24,712
I did it for my country, too.

2017
02:11:24,713 --> 02:11:25,506
Have a drink.

2018
02:11:25,507 --> 02:11:28,046
- I can't drink.
- Please.

2019
02:11:28,047 --> 02:11:30,172
Seriously, I'm taking
tonics these days.

2020
02:11:30,255 --> 02:11:33,547
- Come on, drink it up.
- Oh, stop it.

2021
02:11:34,506 --> 02:11:38,089
Here comes our hero.

2022
02:11:40,172 --> 02:11:42,339
What are you doing? Come inside!

2023
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:46,755
You did it.

2024
02:11:50,464 --> 02:11:52,506
We're still friends, right?

2025
02:11:56,464 --> 02:11:59,047
You fool, why even ask?

2026
02:12:00,963 --> 02:12:02,130
Take it.

2027
02:12:05,922 --> 02:12:07,422
Where are you going?

2028
02:12:07,713 --> 02:12:09,130
To piss.

2029
02:12:29,755 --> 02:12:31,630
Strip down naked.

2030
02:12:41,214 --> 02:12:45,755
Chief, are you in there?

2031
02:13:02,797 --> 02:13:05,922
Here's the authorization
letter for the arrest.

2032
02:13:36,505 --> 02:13:38,922
It's an <i>ex post facto</i> approval.

2033
02:14:09,297 --> 02:14:11,172
From now on,

2034
02:14:12,047 --> 02:14:17,964
we give our lives for our country,
the whole nation and its people.

2035
02:14:19,130 --> 02:14:22,879
For the Republic of Korea.

2036
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:25,671
- We are one!
- One!

2038
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,421
Let's continue.

2039
02:15:11,463 --> 02:15:13,256
Where's that bastard Chun?

2040
02:15:27,047 --> 02:15:29,796
Don't just stand there, come in.

2041
02:15:29,797 --> 02:15:31,629
You should sit here.

2042
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:32,712
- Hee-chul.
- Yes.

2043
02:15:32,713 --> 02:15:34,046
Sit next to General Roh.

2044
02:15:34,047 --> 02:15:35,337
Chang-se, you come here.

2045
02:15:35,338 --> 02:15:38,214
